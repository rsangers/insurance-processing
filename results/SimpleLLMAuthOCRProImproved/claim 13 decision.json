{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nSeveral inconsistencies suggest possible manipulation or poor forgery: the document date (17/11/2023) is earlier than the stated hospitalisation dates in December 2023, there are grammatical and spacing errors (e.g. \"une jours\"), and the signature/stamp area appears low-resolution and possibly pasted. While the header logo appears plausible, mismatched fonts and bolding in the patient line, inconsistent punctuation and alignment, and overall image quality make this document likely suspicious and in need of verification with the issuing hospital.","decision":"DENY"}
