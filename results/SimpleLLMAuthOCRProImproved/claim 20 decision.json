{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document shows multiple inconsistencies (unusual date formatting “Bogotá, Abril 22 del 2020”, mismatch between “coordinadora” in the body and “COORDINADOR” in the signature, inconsistent fonts/weighting and punctuation/spacing) and a low-resolution logo and odd layout that are typical signs of editing. These combined anomalies — plus blurred/uneven contact text and uneven alignment — make the document appear likely altered or fraudulent rather than confidently authentic.","decision":"DENY"}
