0,1,DENY,DENY,medical document missing,"The claim is denied because the name on the provided booking confirmation, 'naveen kumar', does not match the claimant's name, 'Thomas Becker'. Furthermore, the policy requires a medical report for a medical emergency claim, but no such document was submitted."
1,2,DENY,DENY,"medical document missing, the missed the medical appointment is not covered","The claim is for the cost of a missed medical appointment due to a flight delay. The policy covers trip cancellation, loss of personal effects, or missed flight departures, none of which apply to this scenario."
2,3,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency on the day of travel, which is a covered reason. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate confirming the hospitalization and the booking details, fulfilling all policy requirements."
3,4,DENY,DENY,name is redacted,"The claim is denied because the provided medical certificate is dated for the year 2012, while the flight cancellation occurred in 2022. Additionally, the medical certificate does not contain the claimant's name, failing to meet the requirement for valid supporting documentation."
4,5,APPROVE,DENY,NA,"The claim is denied because the name on the medical document, ""Bonfanti Obiiero"", does not match the claimant's name, Olivier Bayante. Additionally, the content of the provided document does not certify a medical condition preventing travel; it appears to be a work-related note."
5,6,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,"the flight is in 2 weeks from now, it is not clear if the person will still be hospitalized or otherwise unable to fly","The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The provided medical certificate confirms the patient's hospitalization began on July 22, 2017, before the scheduled travel date, fulfilling the documentation requirements."
6,7,DENY,UNCERTAIN,the document is generally suspicious: stamp with signature seems photoshopped onto a non-printed document. the document mentions that the person was 'discharged on' but does not have the date.,"The claim for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency is covered by the policy. However, the submitted medical certificate is incomplete as it fails to mention the discharge date, making it unclear if the hospitalization overlapped with the travel date."
7,8,DENY,DENY,the medical document is in text form. this MUST be denied.,"The claim is denied because the supporting medical document was submitted in a text-based markdown format (.md). According to the policy guidelines, claims with medical documents in text form are to be rejected."
8,9,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is approved because the policyholder missed their flight due to a verified medical emergency, which is a covered reason for trip cancellation. The provided medical certificate and flight booking details fully support the claim and meet the policy's requirements for documentation."
9,10,DENY,DENY,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claim is denied because the name on the medical certificate is MONTSERRAT BECERRIL GALVÁN, which does not match the name of the daughter in the claim, LUCÍA FERNÁNDEZ. Furthermore, the medical certificate states the individual was 'clinically healthy', which does not qualify as a medical emergency covered by the policy."
10,11,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is approved as the missed flight resulted from a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant has supplied a valid medical certificate dated on the day of the flight, confirming the diagnosis and a doctor's order for rest, which corroborates the reason for missing the departure."
11,12,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is approved because the missed flight was due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant provided a valid medical certificate confirming hospitalization on the day before the flight, fulfilling all documentation requirements."
12,13,UNCERTAIN,DENY,suspicious dating on the document (17/11/2023 stamp),"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
Several inconsistencies suggest possible manipulation or poor forgery: the document date (17/11/2023) is earlier than the stated hospitalisation dates in December 2023, there are grammatical and spacing errors (e.g. ""une jours""), and the signature/stamp area appears low-resolution and possibly pasted. While the header logo appears plausible, mismatched fonts and bolding in the patient line, inconsistent punctuation and alignment, and overall image quality make this document likely suspicious and in need of verification with the issuing hospital."
13,14,DENY,DENY,medical document states the patient is healthy,"The claim is denied because the supporting medical document contradicts the reason for the claim. The document states that the individual is fit to practice sports, while the claim is based on a medical inability to participate."
14,15,DENY,DENY,the name is obscured in the medical document and visible initials do not correspond,"The claim is denied because the name on the supporting medical document does not match the claimant's name. The medical report lists the patient's initials as ""R, G"", which is insufficient to confirm it belongs to the claimant, Roy Hoffman."
15,16,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is approved because the trip cancellation was due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant has provided both a valid medical certificate confirming hospitalization on the travel date and proof of the train booking."
16,17,DENY,DENY,"documentation states the claimant is in good condition, lacks a signature",The claim is denied because the provided medical document explicitly states the claimant is in good health and fit for physical activity. This evidence contradicts the claim that a medical reason prevented a-ttendance at the sporting event.
17,18,DENY,DENY,a picture is attached instead of the medical certificate,The claim is denied because the supporting document for the medical emergency is not a valid medical report as required by the policy. The provided 'hospital admission document.png' is a text file containing only the word 'HOSPITAL' and lacks any specific medical details.
18,19,APPROVE,DENY,NA,"The claim is denied because the name on the medical certificate, ""Morales Humos"", does not match the claimant's name, ""Marcos Junes"". Additionally, the diagnosis on the certificate is for hearing and vision problems, not gastroenteritis as stated in the claim."
19,20,UNCERTAIN,DENY,no signature on the medical certificate,"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
The document shows multiple inconsistencies (unusual date formatting “Bogotá, Abril 22 del 2020”, mismatch between “coordinadora” in the body and “COORDINADOR” in the signature, inconsistent fonts/weighting and punctuation/spacing) and a low-resolution logo and odd layout that are typical signs of editing. These combined anomalies — plus blurred/uneven contact text and uneven alignment — make the document appear likely altered or fraudulent rather than confidently authentic."
20,21,DENY,DENY,no supporting documentation provided,"The claim for a medical emergency is covered by the policy, but the required medical report was not included in the supporting documents. A claim can be rejected for incomplete documentation, as the policy explicitly states that a medical emergency must be supported by a medical report."
21,22,DENY,DENY,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claim is denied because the reason for missing the trip is not covered by the policy. The provided medical certificate states that the claimant was in perfect health, which does not qualify as a medical emergency."
22,23,UNCERTAIN,UNCERTAIN,the document has weird dating (2016 in the bottom),"The claim is for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. However, the supporting medical certificate was issued on January 5, 2016, which is 22 days after the hospital visit on December 14, 2015, and also appears to be missing a signature, which makes its validity uncertain."
23,24,UNCERTAIN,DENY,minor date problem - appointment is 3 days after the flight,"The claim is denied because the supporting medical document is dated three days after the scheduled date of travel. The certificate does not verify that the claimant was medically unfit to travel on the day of the trip, only that they were diagnosed with an illness three days later."
24,25,DENY,DENY,medical document missing,"The claim is being denied due to incomplete documentation. While a medical emergency is a covered reason, the policy requires a supporting medical report, which was not provided with the claim."
