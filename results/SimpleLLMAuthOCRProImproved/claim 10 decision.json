{"reasoning":"The claim is denied because the name on the medical certificate is MONTSERRAT BECERRIL GALVÁN, which does not match the name of the daughter in the claim, LUCÍA FERNÁNDEZ. Furthermore, the medical certificate states the individual was 'clinically healthy', which does not qualify as a medical emergency covered by the policy.","decision":"DENY"}
