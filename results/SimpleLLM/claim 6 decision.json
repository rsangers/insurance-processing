{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claim details a hospitalization of the traveler (Jorge Velosa Ruiz) which began on July 22, with a flight scheduled for August 15. The claimant (Marta Rojas Valbuena) has provided a medical certificate (though the content is not detailed, its presence is noted) and proof of booking details including the traveler's name, booking reference, and ticket price. The reason for cancellation is the partner's ongoing hospitalization and unsuitability for travel, which falls under the 'medical emergency' clause of the policy. The claim is reported prior to the flight date, and the documentation appears sufficient based on the provided information.","decision":"APPROVE"}
