{"reasoning":"The claim describes a situation where the policyholder's partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since July 22 and is still admitted, making it impossible for them to travel on their scheduled flight on August 15. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a 'medical emergency' if supported by a medical report. While the supporting document 'Spanish_medical_14.webp' is mentioned in the claim description, its content is inaccessible. However, the claimant explicitly states that they have attached a 'certificate from the clinic that confirms everything,' implicitly referring to the inaccessible document. The claim also provides booking details and proof of payment. The hospitalization of the partner constitutes a medical emergency, and the claimant expects this to be covered. Given that the policy explicitly mentions 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason and the claimant states such documentation is provided, the claim meets the criteria for approval, despite the technical issue in accessing the document's content.","decision":"APPROVE"}
