{"reasoning":"The claim is for trip cancellation due to hospitalization of the claimant's mother. The policy covers trip cancellation for medical emergencies, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant has submitted a claim description mentioning hospitalization and has attached a document that is presumably a medical certificate confirming hospitalization. The claim details also indicate the booking information, which is required. Although the actual content of the medical certificate is not readable, the description states it exists and is relevant to the cancellation reason. Therefore, based on the provided information, the claim appears to fall under the covered reason of a medical emergency.","decision":"APPROVE"}
