{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim states that the traveler, Gloria Mi Nano Reyna, had to cancel her flight because she was hospitalized and her condition was too fragile to travel. The claimant has attached a hospital certificate as evidence. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies and the requirement for a medical report. The claim also includes proof of booking and the ticket price, which are also required by the policy. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
