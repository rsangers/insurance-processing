{"reasoning":"The policy covers cancellations due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim explicitly states that the flight was missed due to a serious accident requiring urgent medical attention, including hospitalization and diagnosis by a physician. The claimant also mentions having a signed and sealed document from the attending physician confirming the diagnosis and circumstances. This aligns with the policy requirements for Reason 1 (Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling) under 'Medical emergency'. The claim also includes details about the booking, meeting the 'Proof of booking and amount paid' requirement. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
