{"reasoning":"The user is seeking a refund for a flight cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claim description explicitly mentions a 'serious accident that required urgent medical attention' and states that a 'signed and sealed document issued by Dr. Jorge Andrez Arias Castro' confirming the diagnosis and hospitalization is available. This aligns with the policy's requirement for a medical report. The claim also includes proof of booking and price. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
