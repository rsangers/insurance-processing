{"reasoning":"The policy covers missed departure due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant experienced a severe migraine attack on the day of the flight, which led to hospitalization and a doctor's recommendation for rest, preventing them from making the flight. While the doctor's note content is not readable, the description clearly states it confirms the consultation and prescribed rest. This aligns with the policy's 'Medical emergency' coverage under 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection'.","decision":"APPROVE"}
