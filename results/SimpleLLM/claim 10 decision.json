{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for covered reasons, including medical emergencies supported by a medical report. The claim is for a missed flight due to a mandatory medical check-up for the claimant's daughter. The claimant has provided a description of the event and a document that is stated to be an official medical certificate. Although the full content of the medical document is not readable, the description of the claim explicitly mentions it as supporting evidence for a medical reason. The policy also mentions compensation for missed departure or connection due to a covered reason, which could apply here if the medical check-up is considered a covered reason that caused the missed departure. Given that a medical reason is listed as covered and a medical certificate is claimed to be provided, the claim likely falls under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' or 'Missed Departure' sections. However, without being able to fully read the medical document, there is a slight uncertainty about its completeness or if it explicitly links the check-up to the impossibility of reaching the flight on time. Nevertheless, the provided information strongly suggests a covered event.","decision":"APPROVE"}
