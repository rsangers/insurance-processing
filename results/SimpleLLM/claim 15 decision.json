{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description states that the user had to undergo an urgent pathological-anatomical examination on June 27, 2007, which prevented them from taking their scheduled train trip. The claim includes a supporting document which is described as 'Extracted text from image' and is likely the medical report. The policy also requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is available in the 'internal train data.md' document. Therefore, the claim meets the criteria for coverage under the policy.","decision":"APPROVE"}
