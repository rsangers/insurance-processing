{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim describes a medical issue (sinusitis) that prevented the claimant from traveling on February 2, 2017. A medical certificate from Dr. Elizabeth Cueva, dated February 5, 2017, is provided, although the consultation date is after the scheduled trip. The supporting document also confirms the booking details for the train journey on February 2, 2017. While the medical certificate is dated after the trip and not on the day of the incident, the policy states that a medical emergency is a covered reason and requires a medical report. The claimant attributes the inability to travel to the medical condition which worsened the day before the trip. Given that a medical certificate is provided as support, it is reasonable to consider this a covered reason under the policy, despite the slight delay in medical consultation post the travel date.","decision":"APPROVE"}
