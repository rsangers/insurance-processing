Although the medical certificate was issued a few days after the scheduled travel date, it confirms a medical condition (sinusitis) diagnosed around the time of the trip that prevented the claimant from traveling. The booking details and the price paid are also provided. Since the illness prevented the trip and a medical report is available, the claim should be approved.","decision":"APPROVE"}
