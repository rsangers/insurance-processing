{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim is for a cancelled trip due to a dental emergency on July 12, 2024. The claimant has provided a description of the emergency and a booking confirmation. However, the actual medical report or certificate confirming the dental emergency is missing from the provided documents. Although the description states a 'dental certificate' was attached, it is not present in the provided 'supporting documents'. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved without the essential medical documentation.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
