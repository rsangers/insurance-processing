{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellations for a medical emergency, and the claimant provided both a description of an urgent hospital admission as the reason for not using the train ticket and a supporting medical document (although the content was not readable, the existence of the document related to a hospital admission is noted). The claim provides details about the train ticket (price, date, operator), and the date of admission (April 14, 2017) aligns with the train ticket date (April 14, 2017). The policy requires a medical report for medical emergencies, which was submitted. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered under section 1 of the policy.","decision":"APPROVE"}
