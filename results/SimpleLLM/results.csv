0,1,DENY,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, but it requires a medical report as supporting documentation. The claim mentions a medical emergency but does not provide a medical report. Therefore, the claim is uncertain."
1,2,DENY,DENY,NA,"The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the missed departure is due to a covered reason. The claim states the passenger missed a prepaid medical appointment because their flight was delayed, causing them to not arrive in time for the appointment. The flight details and boarding pass are provided as supporting documents. However, the policy's section on 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' specifically mentions 'traffic accident en route' as an example of a covered reason. The current claim does not specify the reason for the flight not landing in time, only that it 'did not land in time'. Without a covered reason for the flight delay, it is difficult to approve this claim under the 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' clause. It's also not a 'Trip Cancellation' as the trip itself was not cancelled or rescheduled, but rather a prepaid appointment was missed due to travel disruption. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved based on the provided information and policy."
2,3,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description clearly states a medical emergency requiring hospitalization and surgery as the reason for missing the flight. The attached documents include a claim description mentioning hospitalization and surgery, a flight booking detail, and a hospitalization certificate from Clinique Médicale de Bassam for acute pelvic pain, cardiac distress, and gallbladder complications, diagnosed by Dr. Kouassi Kone Francois. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies and the requirement for supporting medical documentation. The claim also provides proof of booking and the cost of the flight."

The supporting documents also include the flight booking details. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies and the required documentation."
4,5,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy states that trip cancellation is covered for a medical emergency if supported by a medical report. The claimant, Olivier Bayante, had to cancel a flight due to feeling unwell at work and provided a note from Dr. Lucini Cristina, the doctor on-site at the retirement home, stating that he was not in a condition to work or travel. This constitutes a medical emergency supported by a medical report. The claimant is requesting compensation for the cancelled flight, which aligns with the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The supporting documents also include details of the booking, which is required by the policy. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered."

The claimant (Marta Rojas Valbuena) has provided a medical certificate (though the content is not detailed, its presence is noted) and proof of booking details including the traveler's name, booking reference, and ticket price. The reason for cancellation is the partner's ongoing hospitalization and unsuitability for travel, which falls under the 'medical emergency' clause of the policy. The claim is reported prior to the flight date, and the documentation appears sufficient based on the provided information."
6,7,DENY,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim states that the traveler, Gloria Mi Nano Reyna, had to cancel her flight because she was hospitalized and her condition was too fragile to travel. The claimant has attached a hospital certificate as evidence. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies and the requirement for a medical report. The claim also includes proof of booking and the ticket price, which are also required by the policy. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered."
7,8,DENY,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is for a flight that was cancelled due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for medical emergencies, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided a hospital admission and discharge summary detailing their medical condition (acute gastroenteritis) and a recommendation from their doctor not to travel for 48 hours, which prevented them from boarding their flight on December 14, 2024. The supporting documents also include proof of booking and the cost of the flight. Therefore, the claim falls under the 'What Is Covered' section of the policy for Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling due to a medical emergency."
8,9,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it's supported by a medical report. The claimant missed their flight on July 29, 2023, due to emergency eye surgery on the same day.

The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, requiring a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant provided a description of the medical emergency and attached a medical certificate. The flight booking details are available in the 'internal flight data.md' document. Therefore, the claim appears to meet the policy requirements for a covered reason. The policy states that a medical emergency is a covered reason if supported by a medical report, which has been provided. The claim is for a missed flight which falls under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy."

The claim includes a supporting document which is described as 'Extracted text from image' and is likely the medical report. The policy also requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is available in the 'internal train data.md' document. Therefore, the claim meets the criteria for coverage under the policy."

The claim also includes proof of booking and price. The incident occurred on April 22, 2020, and the claim was submitted on May 10, 2020, which is within the 30-day reporting period.

21,22,DENY,DENY,NA,"The user is requesting a refund for a train ticket because they missed their scheduled departure due to a medical appointment that took longer than expected. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the cause is a 'covered reason'. The policy lists 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason. However, the user's medical appointment was a routine check-up, and they were found to be in 'perfect health'. This does not constitute a medical emergency. Therefore, missing the train due to a prolonged medical appointment, where no emergency occurred, is not a covered reason under the policy. The claim falls under 'Not a covered reason' as it is a voluntary change or a result of personal scheduling, not an unforeseen medical emergency or other covered event."
22,23,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,NA,"The user is requesting a refund for a hotel reservation due to a medical emergency involving their daughter.

The claim describes a medical issue (sinusitis) that prevented the claimant from traveling on February 2, 2017. A medical certificate from Dr. Elizabeth Cueva, dated February 5, 2017, is provided, although the consultation date is after the scheduled trip. The supporting document also confirms the booking details for the train journey on February 2, 2017. While the medical certificate is dated after the trip and not on the day of the incident, the policy states that a medical emergency is a covered reason and requires a medical report. The claimant attributes the inability to travel to the medical condition which worsened the day before the trip. Given that a medical certificate is provided as support, it is reasonable to consider this a covered reason under the policy, despite the slight delay in medical consultation post the travel date."
24,25,DENY,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim is for a cancelled trip due to a dental emergency on July 12, 2024. The claimant has provided a description of the emergency and a booking confirmation.
