0,1,DENY,UNCERTAIN,medical document missing,"The customer is claiming for a non-refundable booking cancellation due to a medical emergency of their daughter. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The customer has not provided any medical documentation to support their claim. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved or denied at this time."
1,2,DENY,DENY,"medical document missing, the missed the medical appointment is not covered","The user is seeking reimbursement for a prepaid medical appointment that they could not attend due to a flight delay. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the missed departure is due to a covered reason. However, the policy lists 'traffic accident en route' as an example of a covered reason, and the user's reason for missing the appointment was a delayed flight, not a traffic accident en route to the appointment. The policy also has a 'Cancellation For Specific Reason' section which lists 'travel' as a reason for cancellation or rescheduling, but it is not listed as a covered reason. Therefore, based on the provided policy, the claim does not appear to be covered."
2,3,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The insurance policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description details a medical emergency requiring hospitalization and surgery, which prevented the claimant from traveling. The claimant has provided a hospitalization certificate as proof. The policy also requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is present in the supporting documents. Therefore, the claim meets the criteria for coverage."
3,4,DENY,APPROVE,name is redacted,"The claim is for a flight cancellation due to a sudden illness. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided a medical certificate and booking details. The medical certificate states the claimant was unfit to travel from December 22nd to December 24th, which includes the flight date of December 23rd. Therefore, the claim is covered."
4,5,APPROVE,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The policy states that a medical emergency is a covered reason for trip cancellation, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description details a medical emergency where the claimant felt unwell at work and was seen by a doctor on site, Dr. Lucini Cristina, who confirmed they were not in a condition to travel. The claimant mentions attaching a note from Dr. Lucini. Although the document content for 'Italian_medical_2a.jpg' states 'Supporting document could not be read', the description clearly indicates that a medical note exists and was provided. The supporting document 'supporting1.md' provides details about the flight booking, which is also a requirement. Therefore, based on the provided information, the claim appears to meet the criteria for a covered medical emergency cancellation. However, since the core medical documentation could not be read by the system, a definitive approval cannot be made without verifying the content of that document. Thus, the decision is uncertain."
5,6,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,"the flight is in 2 weeks from now, it is not clear if the person will still be hospitalized or otherwise unable to fly","The claim describes a situation where the policyholder's partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, has been hospitalized since July 22 and is still admitted, making it impossible for them to travel on their scheduled flight on August 15. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a 'medical emergency' if supported by a medical report. While the supporting document 'Spanish_medical_14.webp' is mentioned in the claim description, its content is inaccessible. However, the claimant explicitly states that they have attached a 'certificate from the clinic that confirms everything,' implicitly referring to the inaccessible document. The claim also provides booking details and proof of payment. The hospitalization of the partner constitutes a medical emergency, and the claimant expects this to be covered. Given that the policy explicitly mentions 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason and the claimant states such documentation is provided, the claim meets the criteria for approval, despite the technical issue in accessing the document's content."
6,7,DENY,APPROVE,the document is generally suspicious: stamp with signature seems photoshopped onto a non-printed document. the document mentions that the person was 'discharged on' but does not have the date.,"The claim is for trip cancellation due to hospitalization of the claimant's mother. The policy covers trip cancellation for medical emergencies, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant has submitted a claim description mentioning hospitalization and has attached a document that is presumably a medical certificate confirming hospitalization. The claim details also indicate the booking information, which is required. Although the actual content of the medical certificate is not readable, the description states it exists and is relevant to the cancellation reason. Therefore, based on the provided information, the claim appears to fall under the covered reason of a medical emergency."
7,8,DENY,APPROVE,the medical document is in text form. this MUST be denied.,"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant, Naomi Feldman, was admitted to Pacific Grove Medical Center on December 13, 2024, and discharged on December 14, 2024, with advice not to travel for 48 hours due to acute gastroenteritis. This medical emergency prevented her from boarding her flight scheduled for December 14, 2024. The supporting documents include hospital admission and discharge summaries, and flight details with cost. All requirements for coverage appear to be met."
8,9,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy states that a missed departure or missed connection due to a covered reason may be compensated. The claimant missed their flight due to emergency eye surgery, which is classified as a medical emergency and is a covered reason. The claimant provided a medical certificate (though the content was unreadable) and booking details, which are required supporting documents. Therefore, the claim should be approved."
9,10,DENY,APPROVE,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for covered reasons, including medical emergencies supported by a medical report. The claim is for a missed flight due to a mandatory medical check-up for the claimant's daughter. The claimant has provided a description of the event and a document that is stated to be an official medical certificate. Although the full content of the medical document is not readable, the description of the claim explicitly mentions it as supporting evidence for a medical reason. The policy also mentions compensation for missed departure or connection due to a covered reason, which could apply here if the medical check-up is considered a covered reason that caused the missed departure. Given that a medical reason is listed as covered and a medical certificate is claimed to be provided, the claim likely falls under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' or 'Missed Departure' sections. However, without being able to fully read the medical document, there is a slight uncertainty about its completeness or if it explicitly links the check-up to the impossibility of reaching the flight on time. Nevertheless, the provided information strongly suggests a covered event."
10,11,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers missed departure due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant experienced a severe migraine attack on the day of the flight, which led to hospitalization and a doctor's recommendation for rest, preventing them from making the flight. While the doctor's note content is not readable, the description clearly states it confirms the consultation and prescribed rest. This aligns with the policy's 'Medical emergency' coverage under 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection'."
11,12,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which includes hospitalization. The claimant's flight was missed due to an emergency hospitalization for an abdominal trauma, and they have provided a medical certificate as supporting documentation. The flight booking details are also available. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy."
12,13,UNCERTAIN,UNCERTAIN,suspicious dating on the document (17/11/2023 stamp),"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant states they were hospitalized on December 16, 2023, which resulted in missing their flight. The supporting documents include flight booking details for an Air France flight on December 16, 2023, from Paris to Barcelona. There is also a document labeled 'French_medical_4.webp' which is described as 'Supporting document could not be read'. Since the medical document is unreadable, it cannot be confirmed that the hospitalization was a medical emergency and thus a covered reason for cancellation. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved at this time due to insufficient verifiable documentation."
13,14,DENY,DENY,medical document states the patient is healthy,"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking and payment. The claim is for a sports camp that the insured's daughter could not attend due to a medical issue. A medical certificate from Dr. Sylvie on September 5, 2018, states that Lily Fang couldn't participate in physical activities. The booking confirmation shows that Lily Fang was booked for the camp on September 7, 2018, at a cost of €450. The claim meets all the requirements for coverage under section 1 of the policy. The reasoning for denial is that the claim is for a sports camp which is not a trip. The policy has been interpreted narrowly and the claim has been denied."
14,15,DENY,APPROVE,the name is obscured in the medical document and visible initials do not correspond,"The claim states that the insured, Roy Hoffman, missed a train journey on June 27, 2007, due to an urgent pathological-anatomical examination in Frankfurt am Main. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for medical emergencies, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim includes a medical report as supporting documentation. The policy also requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is present in the provided 'internal train data.md' document. The decision to approve the claim is based on the fulfillment of these conditions."
15,16,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellations for a medical emergency, and the claimant provided both a description of an urgent hospital admission as the reason for not using the train ticket and a supporting medical document (although the content was not readable, the existence of the document related to a hospital admission is noted). The claim provides details about the train ticket (price, date, operator), and the date of admission (April 14, 2017) aligns with the train ticket date (April 14, 2017). The policy requires a medical report for medical emergencies, which was submitted. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered under section 1 of the policy."
16,17,DENY,UNCERTAIN,"documentation states the claimant is in good condition, lacks a signature","The user is requesting a refund for a race registration due to medical reasons. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for covered reasons, including medical emergencies, provided there is supporting medical documentation. The user has provided a document claiming to be a medical certificate from a hospital. However, the supporting document 'Spanish_medical_16.webp' is marked as 'Supporting document could not be read'. Without a legible medical certificate, the claim cannot be verified against the policy's requirements."
17,18,DENY,UNCERTAIN,a picture is attached instead of the medical certificate,"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant submitted an 'official hospital admission and discharge documentation' for a medical emergency that prevented them from boarding their flight. The internal flight data confirms the flight booking and the fact that the claimant was a no-show. The only supporting document that could not be read is the hospital admission document. However, the claim description explicitly states this document has been provided and supports the medical emergency. Assuming the document confirms a medical emergency that prevented travel, the claim appears to be covered under section 1 of the policy. Further clarification on the content of the hospital admission document is needed for a definitive decision."
18,19,APPROVE,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The customer is requesting a refund for a train ticket due to a medical emergency (gastroenteritis) that prevented them from traveling. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The customer has provided a description of the illness, the diagnosis, the recommended rest period, and mentions attaching an official medical certificate. The supporting documents include a booking confirmation detailing the train and price, and a placeholder for the medical certificate which could not be read. Assuming the unreadable medical certificate is indeed a valid medical report as described by the customer, the claim would be covered under section 1 of the policy. However, since the document content could not be interpreted, there is a degree of uncertainty. Because the claim falls under a covered reason and the customer has stated they provided the required documentation (medical certificate), the decision leans towards approval, but with the caveat that the validity of the documentation needs to be confirmed."
19,20,UNCERTAIN,UNCERTAIN,no signature on the medical certificate,"The claim is for flight cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant provided a description of the medical emergency and a flight booking confirmation. Although the specific medical certificate was not readable, the policy explicitly states that a medical emergency is a covered reason requiring a medical report. Given the information, it's highly probable that the claim is valid, but a definitive approval requires the actual medical documentation to be reviewed. Therefore, the decision is uncertain."
20,21,DENY,APPROVE,no supporting documentation provided,"The policy covers cancellations due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim explicitly states that the flight was missed due to a serious accident requiring urgent medical attention, including hospitalization and diagnosis by a physician. The claimant also mentions having a signed and sealed document from the attending physician confirming the diagnosis and circumstances. This aligns with the policy requirements for Reason 1 (Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling) under 'Medical emergency'. The claim also includes details about the booking, meeting the 'Proof of booking and amount paid' requirement. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered."
21,22,DENY,APPROVE,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The policy covers claims for missed departure or missed connection due to a covered reason like a medical emergency. The claimant missed their train because a medical appointment took longer than expected. Although the medical document was unreadable, the claim indicates a medical appointment was attended, and the claimant states it was a factor in missing the train. The policy requires proof of booking and documentation explaining the cause of delay, which the claimant has provided (booking details and reference to a medical certificate). The reason for missing the train appears to be a medical-related delay, which is a covered reason under the policy's 'Missed Departure' section. Therefore, the claim should be approved pending verification of the medical document's content if necessary."
22,23,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,the document has weird dating (2016 in the bottom),"The insurance policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided there is a medical report as supporting documentation. The claim description states that the hotel reservation could not be used due to a medical emergency involving the claimant's daughter. A medical certificate from a physician confirming the emergency and the need for bed rest is mentioned as an attachment. The policy requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is also available in the supporting documents. The medical certificate itself could not be read by the system, but the description of the claim clearly indicates its existence and relevance. Given this, the claim appears to be covered under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy."
23,24,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,minor date problem - appointment is 3 days after the flight,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which requires a medical report. Although the medical certificate was issued a few days after the scheduled travel date, it confirms a medical condition (sinusitis) diagnosed around the time of the trip that prevented the claimant from traveling. The booking details and the price paid are also provided. Since the illness prevented the trip and a medical report is available, the claim should be approved."
24,25,DENY,APPROVE,medical document missing,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which requires a medical report as supporting documentation. The claim states a dental emergency (abscess) necessitated the cancellation, and a dental certificate was provided. The booking confirmation is also present. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies."
