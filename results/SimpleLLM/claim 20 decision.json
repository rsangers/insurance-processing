{"reasoning":"The claim is for flight cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant provided a description of the medical emergency and a flight booking confirmation. Although the specific medical certificate was not readable, the policy explicitly states that a medical emergency is a covered reason requiring a medical report. Given the information, it's highly probable that the claim is valid, but a definitive approval requires the actual medical documentation to be reviewed. Therefore, the decision is uncertain.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
