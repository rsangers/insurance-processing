{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it's supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant, Daniel Romero, missed his flight on December 14, 2024, due to an admitted medical emergency, providing hospital admission and discharge documentation. This aligns with the policy's 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' clause for medical emergencies. The supporting documents, including the hospital admission document and internal flight data, confirm the medical emergency and the fact that the flight was missed. The claim appears to meet the requirements for this coverage.","decision":"APPROVE"}
