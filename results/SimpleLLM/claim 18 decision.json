{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant submitted an 'official hospital admission and discharge documentation' for a medical emergency that prevented them from boarding their flight. The internal flight data confirms the flight booking and the fact that the claimant was a no-show. The only supporting document that could not be read is the hospital admission document. However, the claim description explicitly states this document has been provided and supports the medical emergency. Assuming the document confirms a medical emergency that prevented travel, the claim appears to be covered under section 1 of the policy. Further clarification on the content of the hospital admission document is needed for a definitive decision.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
