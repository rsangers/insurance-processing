{"reasoning":"The policy states that trip cancellation is covered for a medical emergency if supported by a medical report. The claimant, Olivier Bayante, had to cancel a flight due to feeling unwell at work and provided a note from Dr. Lucini Cristina, the doctor on-site at the retirement home, stating that he was not in a condition to work or travel. This constitutes a medical emergency supported by a medical report. The claimant is requesting compensation for the cancelled flight, which aligns with the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The supporting documents also include details of the booking, which is required by the policy. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
