{"reasoning":"The policy states that a medical emergency is a covered reason for trip cancellation, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description details a medical emergency where the claimant felt unwell at work and was seen by a doctor on site, Dr. Lucini Cristina, who confirmed they were not in a condition to travel. The claimant mentions attaching a note from Dr. Lucini. Although the document content for 'Italian_medical_2a.jpg' states 'Supporting document could not be read', the description clearly indicates that a medical note exists and was provided. The supporting document 'supporting1.md' provides details about the flight booking, which is also a requirement. Therefore, based on the provided information, the claim appears to meet the criteria for a covered medical emergency cancellation. However, since the core medical documentation could not be read by the system, a definitive approval cannot be made without verifying the content of that document. Thus, the decision is uncertain.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
