{"reasoning":"The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the missed departure is due to a covered reason. The claim states the passenger missed a prepaid medical appointment because their flight was delayed, causing them to not arrive in time for the appointment. The flight details and boarding pass are provided as supporting documents. However, the policy's section on 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' specifically mentions 'traffic accident en route' as an example of a covered reason. The current claim does not specify the reason for the flight not landing in time, only that it 'did not land in time'. Without a covered reason for the flight delay, it is difficult to approve this claim under the 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' clause. It's also not a 'Trip Cancellation' as the trip itself was not cancelled or rescheduled, but rather a prepaid appointment was missed due to travel disruption. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved based on the provided information and policy.","decision":"DENY"}
