{"reasoning":"The user is seeking reimbursement for a prepaid medical appointment that they could not attend due to a flight delay. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the missed departure is due to a covered reason. However, the policy lists 'traffic accident en route' as an example of a covered reason, and the user's reason for missing the appointment was a delayed flight, not a traffic accident en route to the appointment. The policy also has a 'Cancellation For Specific Reason' section which lists 'travel' as a reason for cancellation or rescheduling, but it is not listed as a covered reason. Therefore, based on the provided policy, the claim does not appear to be covered.","decision":"DENY"}
