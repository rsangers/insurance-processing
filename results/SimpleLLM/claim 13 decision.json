{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant states they were hospitalized on December 16, 2023, which resulted in missing their flight. The supporting documents include flight booking details for an Air France flight on December 16, 2023, from Paris to Barcelona. There is also a document labeled 'French_medical_4.webp' which is described as 'Supporting document could not be read'. Since the medical document is unreadable, it cannot be confirmed that the hospitalization was a medical emergency and thus a covered reason for cancellation. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved at this time due to insufficient verifiable documentation.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
