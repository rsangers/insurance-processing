{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it's supported by a medical report. The claimant missed their flight on July 29, 2023, due to emergency eye surgery on the same day. The medical certificate confirms the surgery and the required rest period from July 29 to August 12, 2023, which prevented them from traveling. This directly falls under the 'Medical emergency' clause for covered reasons in the policy. The claimant has provided the medical certificate and proof of booking and cost, fulfilling the requirements. Therefore, the claim for the missed flight due to a medical emergency is covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
