{"reasoning":"The user is requesting a refund for a train ticket because they missed their scheduled departure due to a medical appointment that took longer than expected. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the cause is a 'covered reason'. The policy lists 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason. However, the user's medical appointment was a routine check-up, and they were found to be in 'perfect health'. This does not constitute a medical emergency. Therefore, missing the train due to a prolonged medical appointment, where no emergency occurred, is not a covered reason under the policy. The claim falls under 'Not a covered reason' as it is a voluntary change or a result of personal scheduling, not an unforeseen medical emergency or other covered event.","decision":"DENY"}
