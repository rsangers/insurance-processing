{"reasoning":"The policy covers claims for missed departure or missed connection due to a covered reason like a medical emergency. The claimant missed their train because a medical appointment took longer than expected. Although the medical document was unreadable, the claim indicates a medical appointment was attended, and the claimant states it was a factor in missing the train. The policy requires proof of booking and documentation explaining the cause of delay, which the claimant has provided (booking details and reference to a medical certificate). The reason for missing the train appears to be a medical-related delay, which is a covered reason under the policy's 'Missed Departure' section. Therefore, the claim should be approved pending verification of the medical document's content if necessary.","decision":"APPROVE"}
