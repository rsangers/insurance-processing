{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description clearly states a medical emergency requiring hospitalization and surgery as the reason for missing the flight. The attached documents include a claim description mentioning hospitalization and surgery, a flight booking detail, and a hospitalization certificate from Clinique Médicale de Bassam for acute pelvic pain, cardiac distress, and gallbladder complications, diagnosed by Dr. Kouassi Kone Francois. This aligns with the policy's coverage for medical emergencies and the requirement for supporting medical documentation. The claim also provides proof of booking and the cost of the flight.","decision":"APPROVE"}
