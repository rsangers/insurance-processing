{"reasoning":"The insurance policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided there is a medical report as supporting documentation. The claim description states that the hotel reservation could not be used due to a medical emergency involving the claimant's daughter. A medical certificate from a physician confirming the emergency and the need for bed rest is mentioned as an attachment. The policy requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is also available in the supporting documents. The medical certificate itself could not be read by the system, but the description of the claim clearly indicates its existence and relevance. Given this, the claim appears to be covered under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy.","decision":"APPROVE"}
