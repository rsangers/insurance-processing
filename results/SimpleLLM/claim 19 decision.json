{"reasoning":"The customer is requesting a refund for a train ticket due to a medical emergency (gastroenteritis) that prevented them from traveling. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The customer has provided a description of the illness, the diagnosis, the recommended rest period, and mentions attaching an official medical certificate. The supporting documents include a booking confirmation detailing the train and price, and a placeholder for the medical certificate which could not be read. Assuming the unreadable medical certificate is indeed a valid medical report as described by the customer, the claim would be covered under section 1 of the policy. However, since the document content could not be interpreted, there is a degree of uncertainty. Because the claim falls under a covered reason and the customer has stated they provided the required documentation (medical certificate), the decision leans towards approval, but with the caveat that the validity of the documentation needs to be confirmed.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
