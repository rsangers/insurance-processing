{"reasoning":"The user is claiming for a missed flight due to emergency eye surgery. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the reason is covered. The description states the surgery was unplanned and medically necessary, and a medical certificate is provided. This falls under the 'medical emergency' clause of the policy, which is a covered reason for trip cancellation or rescheduling. Although the claim is for a missed departure, the underlying cause is a medical emergency that made the user unfit to travel, which is explicitly mentioned as a covered reason. The claim requests compensation for the full ticket price of 129 euros, which is within the scope of 'up to the total bill amount' mentioned for trip cancellation. The supporting documents include a medical certificate (though its content is unreadable) and booking details, fulfilling the 'valid supporting documentation' and 'proof of booking' requirements. Therefore, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
