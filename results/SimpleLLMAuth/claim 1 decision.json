{"reasoning":"The insurance policy covers trip cancellations due to medical emergencies, provided that a medical report is submitted as supporting documentation. The claim description mentions a medical emergency involving the claimant's daughter due to a severe allergic reaction. However, the supporting documents provided do not contain a medical report. The booking confirmation document was unreadable and the other document only contains the current date. Without a medical report to substantiate the emergency, the claim cannot be approved.","decision":"DENY"}
