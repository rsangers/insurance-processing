{"reasoning":"The customer is claiming reimbursement for a flight cancellation due to a sudden illness. The policy covers trip cancellation for medical emergencies, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The customer has provided a flight booking detail and stated that a medical certificate was issued. Although the content of the medical certificate is not fully readable, the description states it declares the customer unfit to travel and work due to illness from December 22nd to 24th, which aligns with the flight cancellation date of December 23rd. The claim appears to meet the criteria for coverage under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section for a medical emergency.","decision":"APPROVE"}
