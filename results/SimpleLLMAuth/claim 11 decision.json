{"reasoning":"The policy covers missed departure due to a covered reason. The claimant missed their flight due to a medical emergency (severe migraine attack treated at the hospital), which is listed as a covered reason under \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling\" and can also be interpreted as a covered reason for \"Missed Departure or Missed Connection\". The claimant has provided a description of the medical emergency and stated that a doctor's note confirming the consultation and prescribed rest is attached. The supporting documents include a confirmation of the flight details and booking information. However, the actual medical document confirming the emergency and prescribed rest period, which is crucial for substantiating the claim under a medical emergency, was not readable ('Supporting document could not be read' for 'medical 3.webp'). Without this essential documentation, it is impossible to verify the medical emergency and the direct impact on missing the departure. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved at this time.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
