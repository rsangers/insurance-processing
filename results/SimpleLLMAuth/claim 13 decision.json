{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document shows multiple inconsistencies: the issuance date (17/11/2023) is earlier than the stated hospitalization dates (16/12/2023–17/12/2023), there are grammatical and punctuation errors, inconsistent date formatting and odd spacing in the body text. The signature/stamp area is low-resolution and smeared with overlapping text while the printed header and main text differ in sharpness, suggesting copying/alteration — overall the file appears likely fraudulent or altered.","decision":"DENY"}
