{"reasoning":"The claim is for a flight cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling\" section of the policy. The claimant has provided a booking reference, flight details, and stated that they were hospitalized on the date of the flight. Although the medical document itself could not be read, the description of the claim clearly states it is a medical emergency and refers to a hospitalization certification. The policy requires a medical report, and while the provided document is unreadable, the claim description provides sufficient context to reasonably infer that this document is the required medical report. The flight details and price paid are also available. Therefore, the claim appears to meet the criteria for approval.","decision":"APPROVE"}
