{"reasoning":"The user is requesting a reimbursement for a train ticket because they were hospitalized and could not use it. The insurance policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description mentions hospitalization and attaches a supporting document. However, the content of the medical document is indicated as unreadable. Therefore, while the reason appears to be covered, the necessary supporting documentation is not sufficiently verifiable to approve the claim.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
