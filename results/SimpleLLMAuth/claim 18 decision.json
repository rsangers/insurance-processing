{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant states they were admitted to the hospital due to acute abdominal pain and were advised not to travel. Although the content of the hospital admission document could not be read, the claim description explicitly mentions a medical emergency and hospitalization. The policy requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is not explicitly provided in the supporting documents for this specific claim, only flight details. However, the policy states 'Up to the total bill amount, depending on your policy and documentation', implying that a full bill amount may not always be the basis for payout. Given that the primary reason for cancellation (medical emergency) is stated and supported by a reference to a hospital admission document, and the claim falls under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy, the claim should be approved pending verification of the provided hospital document to confirm the medical emergency and any associated costs that might be reimbursed.","decision":"APPROVE"}
