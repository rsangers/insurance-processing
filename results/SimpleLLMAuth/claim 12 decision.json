{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to medical emergencies if supported by a medical report. The claimant provided a description of an emergency hospitalization which prevented her from traveling to the airport for her flight. The supporting documents include information about the flight and a mention of a medical certificate, although the content of that certificate could not be read. Given that the policy explicitly mentions medical emergencies as a covered reason and the claimant states she was hospitalized, the claim should be approved pending the successful verification of the medical certificate.","decision":"APPROVE"}
