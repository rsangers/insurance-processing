{"reasoning":"Summary of observations:\n- Missing critical elements normally found on an authentic medical certificate: there is no date filled in, no visible physician signature, no printed name, license number or stamp of the treating physician, and no hospital logo, contact details or official stamp/seal. The footer line labeled for the treating physician is blank. These omissions strongly indicate the document is incomplete or a template rather than a finalized official certificate.\n- Formatting and typography: the layout looks like a simple digital template (centered title, left-aligned header text). One line in the body is emphasized (bold/underlined) to show the person and ID; that emphasis is plausible but could also be an inserted text field. The ID prefix is written with a lowercase letter and an extra space before the numeric groups and uses period separators; that is an inconsistent formatting choice compared with common official practice where prefixes are usually uppercase and spacing is consistent.\n- Language/punctuation: there are small punctuation/spacing inconsistencies (for example an inconsistent use of commas and semicolons inside the main sentence) and an odd semicolon immediately after the ID. Those are signs of sloppiness or manual editing rather than a carefully issued official document.\n- Image evidence of tampering: I do not see obvious visual artefacts like mismatched fonts within single words, clear copy-paste box outlines, or cloning patterns in the paper texture from this resolution. However, the entire page appears very clean and uniformly rendered (low noise), which is typical for a computer-generated/printed template rather than an authenticated scanned document with stamps and pen marks.\n- Contextual red flags: an official hospital-issued medical certificate would normally include a date, signature, physician identification/registration number and an institutional stamp or letterhead. The absence of all of these on this page is a strong indicator of low authenticity.\n\nAssessment: Potentially fraudulent / not a completed official document.\nReason: missing date, no signature/physician name/license number, no hospital logo or stamp, odd ID formatting and punctuation inconsistencies, and overall appearance of an unfilled template rather than a finalized certified record. While there are no blatant visual signs of pixel-level image manipulation detectable at this resolution, the substantive missing elements make this document unreliable.\n\nRecommended next steps if verification is required: contact the issuing hospital directly using independently obtained contact details and request confirmation; ask for a signed/stamped copy that includes physician identification and date.\n","decision":"DENY"}
