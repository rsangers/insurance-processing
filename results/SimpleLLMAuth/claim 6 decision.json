{"reasoning":"The user is requesting a refund for a flight booked for August 15th due to a medical emergency. The supporting document confirms that Jorge Velosa Ruiz, the user's partner and travel companion, has been hospitalized since July 22nd and is still admitted. The policy covers trip cancellation due to medical emergencies, provided there is a medical report. Although the document provided is an image and the content could not be read, the claim description explicitly states that a certificate from the clinic confirming the hospitalization is attached. Assuming this certificate is the medical report and it substantiates the claim of a medical emergency, the claim appears to be covered. The policy requires proof of booking and amount paid, which is also detailed in the supporting document. Therefore, based on the available information, the claim should be approved.","decision":"APPROVE"}
