{"reasoning":"The user is requesting a refund for a train ticket that was missed due to a medical emergency. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'medical emergency' if supported by a medical report. The claim description includes a mention of a medical certificate from a doctor diagnosing gastroenteritis, which falls under the definition of a medical emergency and is a covered reason. The supporting documents include information about the booking details, which is also required by the policy. The only potential issue is that the document 'Spanish_medical_6.jpeg' could not be read, but the claim description explicitly mentions a 'medical certificate issued by the attending physician', implying that the required documentation might exist and was provided, even if not readable by the system. Therefore, based on the information provided and the policy terms, the claim appears to be covered.","decision":"APPROVE"}
