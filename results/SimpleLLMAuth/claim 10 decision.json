{"reasoning":"The policy covers missed departure due to a covered reason. The claimant missed their flight due to a mandatory medical check-up for their daughter. While the details of the medical check-up are not fully available due to the document being unreadable, the claimant states it was a mandatory check-up, which could potentially be interpreted as a 'medical emergency' or a 'personal emergency' that prevented them from reaching the flight. However, the policy specifically mentions 'medical emergency' requires a medical report, and while a medical certificate is attached, its content is unreadable. The claim doesn't explicitly state it was an 'emergency,' but rather a 'required check-up.' Given the ambiguity and the unreadable supporting document, a definitive decision is difficult. The policy does mention 'Other specified personal emergencies' as a covered reason, but the nature of the medical check-up isn't fully clear if it falls under emergency provisions. Therefore, the claim is uncertain.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
