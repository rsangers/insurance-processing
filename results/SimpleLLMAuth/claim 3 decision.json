{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document shows multiple signs of manipulation and poor editorial consistency — the stated total (491 300 FCFA) does not equal the sum of the listed line items (which add to ~621 300 FCFA), font styles and colors are inconsistent, and graphic elements (red URGENT stamp, blue signature and black clinic stamp) appear low-resolution and irregularly overlaid. The use of a generic email domain, odd formatting (slashes before amounts, misaligned table), and visual artifacts around seals/signature make this appear potentially fraudulent rather than reliably authentic.","decision":"DENY"}
