{"reasoning":"The user is seeking reimbursement for a cancelled flight due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation for medical emergencies if supported by a medical report. The user has provided a description of a medical emergency and attached a document, 'Italian_medical_2a.jpg', which is described as a note from Dr. Lucini confirming the claimant was unfit to work or travel. However, the content of this document could not be read. The 'supporting1.md' document provides flight details as required. Without the complete content of the medical note, it is impossible to verify if it meets the policy's requirement for a medical report. Therefore, the decision is UNCERTAIN.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
