{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claim description states a dental emergency (abscess) necessitating trip cancellation and mentions a 'dental certificate' as supporting documentation. However, the provided supporting documents do not contain the actual dental certificate, only a booking confirmation. Without the medical documentation explicitly confirming the emergency and its impact on the ability to travel, the claim cannot be approved. The booking confirmation is present, but the crucial medical evidence is missing.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
