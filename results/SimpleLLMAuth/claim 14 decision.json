{"reasoning":"The user is filing a claim for a sports camp that their daughter, Lily Fang, missed due to a medical issue. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claim description includes that the daughter was unable to participate due to a medical reason, and a medical certificate was issued by a doctor on September 5, 2018, stating she cannot participate in physical activities. The booking confirmation shows the camp was booked for Lily Fang on September 7, 2018, for €450. The medical certificate is dated before the camp started. Since the policy covers cancellation due to medical emergencies, and the user has provided a medical certificate and proof of booking, the claim should be approved. The fact that the medical certificate was issued and the reason for non-participation was known before the camp took place is crucial, and aligns with coverage for medical emergencies.","decision":"APPROVE"}
