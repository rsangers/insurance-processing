{"reasoning":"The claim is for a train journey that was cancelled due to a medical issue (sinusitis). The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant provided a medical certificate from Dr. Elizabeth Cueva confirming a diagnosis of sinusitis and a consultation on February 5, 2017. Although the consultation was after the travel date (February 2, 2017), the claimant states the illness worsened the day before travel and impacted their ability to travel. The medical certificate, along with the booking details, satisfies the policy requirements.","decision":"APPROVE"}
