{"reasoning":"The user is requesting reimbursement for a train ticket that was not used due to a medical appointment. The policy covers trip cancellation or rescheduling for covered reasons, including medical emergencies supported by a medical report. The user provided a medical certificate, although the content of the document could not be read. The user also provided a booking confirmation for the train ticket. The reason for missing the train is that the medical appointment took longer than expected, which is a consequence of a medical emergency. However, the policy states that a medical emergency must be supported by a medical report, and the provided medical document's content is unavailable. The claim also fits under 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' if the delay was due to a covered reason, but the user states they voluntarily stayed longer due to 'legal requirements' which are not detailed.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
