{"reasoning":"The claim is for the cancellation of a sports camp for the claimant's daughter, Lily Fang, due to a stated medical issue. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a valid medical report. The claimant has provided proof of booking for €450 and a medical certificate for Lily Fang dated September 5, 2018, which is before the event on September 7, 2018. However, the medical certificate explicitly states that Lily Fang 'Ne présente actuellement aucune contre-indication apparente à la pratique du sport suivant Course à Pied, y compris en compétition,' which translates to 'Currently presents no apparent contraindication to the practice of the following sport Running, including in competition.' This document certifies that the child is fit for sports, rather than being unfit to participate. The evidence provided directly contradicts the basis of the claim, which is that a medical issue prevented participation. As the required supporting documentation does not validate the reason for the claim, the claim is denied.","decision":"DENY"}
