{"reasoning":"The claim is for a flight cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a specifically covered reason under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The policy requires valid supporting documentation, including a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant has provided a 'hospital admission document.png', which substantiates the medical emergency, and 'internal flight data.md', which confirms the flight booking and the fact that the claimant was a no-show. The timeline of the claim is also within reasonable limits, as the flight was on December 14, 2024, and the claim is being processed on January 10, 2025, which is less than the 30-day limit for late reporting mentioned in the exclusions. As all stated requirements are met, the claim should be approved.","decision":"APPROVE"}
