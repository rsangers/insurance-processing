{"reasoning":"The claimant missed their flight on December 16, 2023, due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The claimant has provided the required supporting documents. The hospitalization certificate from Hôpital Saint-Louis confirms the claimant was hospitalized on the same day as his scheduled flight. The internal flight data confirms the booking details and the price paid. Although the date the certificate was issued ('Fait à PARIS le 17/11/2023') precedes the hospitalization date, this is assessed as a likely clerical error, as the document's content correctly refers to the hospitalization of December 16-17, 2023 in the past tense. The claim fulfills the policy's conditions for a medical emergency.","decision":"APPROVE"}
