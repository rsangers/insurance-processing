{"reasoning":"The claim is denied due to invalid supporting documentation. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, but requires a valid medical report. The provided document, intended as a medical certificate, has critical discrepancies. Firstly, the name on the certificate is 'Bonfanti Obiiero', which does not match the claimant's name, 'Olivier Bayante'. Secondly, the content of the note does not confirm a medical emergency or declare the individual unfit to travel. Instead, it appears to discuss work hours ('Will have the job post at 12.30...') and mentions being attached to a 'curriculum'. As the documentation fails to substantiate a medical emergency for the claimant, the claim does not meet the policy requirements.","decision":"DENY"}
