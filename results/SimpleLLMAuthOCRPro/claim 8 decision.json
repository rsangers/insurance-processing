The claimant has provided a hospital admission record confirming she was admitted on December 13, 2024, for acute gastroenteritis and was not discharged until 16:35 on December 14, 2024. Her flight was scheduled for 08:20 on December 14, 2024, making it impossible for her to have boarded. The medical report also advised against travel for 48 hours. The claim is supported by the required medical documentation and proof of booking, meeting all policy conditions for approval.","decision":"APPROVE"}
