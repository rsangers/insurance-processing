{"reasoning":"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant has provided proof of booking for a flight on December 23, 2022. However, the supporting medical certificate is dated December 21, 2012, and covers an inability to work from December 20, 2012, to December 24, 2012. This document is from ten years prior to the scheduled travel and does not substantiate the claim that the policyholder was ill and unable to travel in December 2022. Due to the discrepancy in dates, the provided medical certificate is not valid for this claim. Therefore, the claim is denied for failing to provide valid supporting documentation for the covered reason.","decision":"DENY"}
