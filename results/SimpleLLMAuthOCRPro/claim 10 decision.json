{"reasoning":"The claim is denied for two primary reasons. Firstly, there is a significant discrepancy in the supporting documentation. The medical certificate provided is for a child named 'MONTSERRAT BECERRIL GALVÁN', whereas the claim is made for the claimant's daughter, 'LUCÍA FERNÁNDEZ'. This invalidates the medical certificate as proof for this specific claim. Secondly, even if the names matched, the policy covers cancellations or missed departures due to a 'Medical emergency'. The provided document and the claim description indicate a scheduled, non-emergency medical check-up where the child was found to be 'CLÍNICAMENTE SANA' (Clinically Healthy). A routine check-up does not qualify as a medical emergency under the terms of the policy. Therefore, the reason for missing the flight is not a covered event.","decision":"DENY"}
