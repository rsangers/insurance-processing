{"reasoning":"The claimant, Thomas Becker, is requesting compensation for a non-refundable hotel booking due to a trip cancellation caused by a medical emergency involving his daughter. According to the 'Cancellation For Specific Reason' policy, 'Trip Cancellation' due to a 'Medical emergency' is a covered reason. However, the policy explicitly states that a medical emergency 'must be supported by a medical report'. The claimant has not submitted any medical documentation to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, there is a significant discrepancy between the claimant's name (Thomas Becker) and the name on the booking confirmation (naveen kumar). To proceed, the claimant must provide a medical report detailing the emergency and clarify their relationship to the booking. Due to the lack of mandatory supporting documentation and the name discrepancy, the claim cannot be approved at this time.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
