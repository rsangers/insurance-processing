{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, which must be supported by a medical report. The claimant, Piccirilly Francesca, submitted a claim for a train ticket she could not use on April 14, 2017, due to an urgent hospitalization on that same day. The supporting documents confirm this. The 'Certificato di Ricovero' (hospitalization certificate) validates that she was admitted to the hospital on April 14, 2017. The 'internal train data.md' document confirms her booking for a train journey on the same date. Since a medical emergency is a covered reason and the claimant has provided both the required medical documentation and proof of booking, the claim meets the policy's criteria for approval.","decision":"APPROVE"}
