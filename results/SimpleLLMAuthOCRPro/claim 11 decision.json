{"reasoning":"The claimant missed her flight on January 25, 2023, due to a severe migraine, which is considered a medical emergency. The policy explicitly covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate dated on the day of the flight, which confirms the diagnosis ('MIGRANA SEVERA'), the time of the hospital visit (11:45 to 12:52), and the doctor's recommendation for 12 hours of rest. Given the flight's departure time of 15:10, it would have been impossible for the claimant to travel. The claimant has also provided the necessary flight booking confirmation. The provided documentation is sufficient and aligns with the policy's requirements for a covered event. No exclusions apply.","decision":"APPROVE"}
