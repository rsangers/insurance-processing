{"reasoning":"The claimant is requesting reimbursement for a prepaid medical appointment that was missed due to a flight delay. The policy provided is a \"Cancellation For Specific Reason\" insurance policy. Upon review of the policy sections, the claim does not meet the criteria for coverage. The \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling\" section applies when a trip is cancelled for reasons like jury duty or a medical emergency, which is not the case here. The \"Personal Effects\" section is irrelevant. The \"Missed Departure or Missed Connection\" section covers missing a flight or connection, but the claimant was on his flight; it was the flight's late arrival that caused him to miss his appointment. The policy does not include a \"Travel Delay\" provision that would cover consequential losses, such as a missed prepaid event at the destination. Therefore, the claim is denied because the event (missing an appointment due to a flight delay) is not a covered reason under any section of the policy.","decision":"DENY"}
