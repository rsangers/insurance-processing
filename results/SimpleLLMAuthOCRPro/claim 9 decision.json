{"reasoning":"The claim is for the cost of a missed flight due to a medical emergency. The policy's 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section explicitly lists 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate from Centro Médico Integral NOVAMEDIC, which confirms an emergency eye surgery on the day of the flight, July 29, 2023, and a prescribed rest period that made travel impossible. The claimant has also supplied proof of the flight booking and its cost (€129). As all required documentation has been provided for a covered event, the claim is valid. The requested amount of €129 is the total bill amount, which is in line with the policy's payout terms for trip cancellation.","decision":"APPROVE"}
