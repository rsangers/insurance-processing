{"reasoning":"The claimant is requesting a refund for a train journey missed on February 2, 2017, due to a medical issue. The policy covers trip cancellation for a 'Medical emergency' when supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided both a booking confirmation and a medical certificate. The medical certificate, dated February 5, 2017, confirms a diagnosis of Sinusitis for the claimant. Although the medical consultation occurred three days after the scheduled travel date, the policy does not explicitly require the consultation to be on the exact date of travel. The documentation confirms a valid medical condition that would reasonably prevent travel. The claim includes all required documentation and falls under a covered reason. Therefore, the claim is approved.","decision":"APPROVE"}
