{"reasoning":"The claimant, Evelyne Kacou Meitiale, is filing for a trip cancellation reimbursement. The policy covers trip cancellations for a 'Medical emergency' provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant was scheduled to fly on August 13, 2011. The supporting document, a 'CERTIFICAT D'HOSPITALISATION' from Clinique Médicale de Bassam, confirms Ms. Kacou Meitiale was admitted to the hospital on August 13, 2011, for a serious medical emergency (biliary colic, cholelithiasis, cardiac distress) requiring hospitalization and surgery. This document serves as the required medical report. Since the medical emergency occurred on the day of travel and is properly documented, the claim falls under the covered reasons for Trip Cancellation. The claimant has also provided proof of booking. Therefore, the claim meets the policy requirements for approval.","decision":"APPROVE"}
