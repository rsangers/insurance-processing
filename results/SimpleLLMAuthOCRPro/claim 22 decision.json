{"reasoning":"The claimant, José Juan Robledo Romero, is requesting a refund for a train ticket he missed on October 19, 2015. He states that a medical check-up on the same day took longer than expected, causing him to miss his departure. The policy covers trip cancellation for specific reasons, including a 'medical emergency'. The claimant provided a medical certificate dated for the day of travel; however, this certificate explicitly states that he is in 'Prefecto estado de Salud' (Perfect state of Health) and his diagnosis is 'SANO' (HEALTHY). This indicates the visit was a routine check-up, not a medical emergency. The 'Missed Departure' section of the policy covers unforeseen incidents, using 'traffic accident en route' as an example. A planned appointment that runs late does not fit this category of unforeseen emergency and is considered a result of personal planning. Therefore, the reason for missing the train is not a covered event under the policy.","decision":"DENY"}
