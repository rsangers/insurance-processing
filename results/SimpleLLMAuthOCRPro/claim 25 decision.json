{"reasoning":"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a stated dental emergency. According to the policy, 'Trip Cancellation' due to a 'Medical emergency' is a covered reason. The provided supporting documents confirm the booking details, including the price of €1594.44 and the check-in date of July 12, 2024. However, the policy explicitly requires that a medical emergency 'must be supported by a medical report'. While the claimant mentions an 'attached dental certificate,' this document has not been provided in the claim submission. Under the 'What Is Not Covered' section, a claim can be rejected for 'Incomplete documentation'. As the mandatory medical certificate is missing, the claim cannot be approved at this time. The decision is UNCERTAIN, pending the submission of the required proof of the medical emergency.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
