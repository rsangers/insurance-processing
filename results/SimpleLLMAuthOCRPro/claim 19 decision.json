{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a valid medical report. The claimant, Marcos Junes, has submitted a claim for a missed train on September 20, 2013, due to a medical issue. While proof of booking is provided, the supporting medical certificate is issued to a different person, 'Horacio Humos,' not the claimant. Because the medical documentation does not pertain to the claimant, it fails to meet the policy's requirement for valid supporting documentation. Therefore, the claim is denied.","decision":"DENY"}
