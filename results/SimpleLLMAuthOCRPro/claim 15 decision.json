{"reasoning":"The claimant, Roy Hoffman, is seeking a refund for a train ticket booked for June 27, 2007. The reason for the claim is an urgent pathological-anatomical examination that took place on the same day, preventing him from traveling. The policy's 'Trip Cancellation' section covers cancellations due to a 'Medical emergency' when supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided a medical report from a pathology practice dated June 27, 2007, which confirms a medical procedure was performed. This aligns with the policy's requirements for a covered reason. However, the policy contains an exclusion for 'Late reporting', which states a claim may be rejected if submitted more than 30 days after the policy expired. Assuming the policy expired on the day of the trip, June 27, 2007, the deadline for submission would have been July 27, 2007. The internal data indicates the current date is August 8, 2007, which is 42 days after the policy's expiration. As the claim was submitted outside the 30-day reporting period, it is subject to denial based on this exclusion.","decision":"DENY"}
