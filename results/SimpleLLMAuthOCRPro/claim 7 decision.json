{"reasoning":"The claim is for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant has provided both. The supporting documents confirm the traveler's name (Gloria Emperatriz Mi Nano Reyna), the booking details, and a medical certificate from Clínica Sánchez Ferrer. The certificate states that the traveler was hospitalized on August 13, 2015. As the flight was scheduled for September 13, 2015, the hospitalization directly prevented the traveler from undertaking the trip. Although the discharge date is not clearly visible on the document, the document itself is dated September 15, 2015, which is after the flight's departure date, substantiating the claim that the traveler was not fit to travel. The claim meets the policy's requirements for a covered cancellation.","decision":"APPROVE"}
