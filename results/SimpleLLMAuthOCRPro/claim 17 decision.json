{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document appears to be a blank template or digitally produced certificate rather than a completed official medical record: it lacks a date, treating physician name, signature and official stamp/seal, and contains inconsistent formatting (underlined/bold name and unusual punctuation in the ID) suggesting it was not finalized or may have been edited. There are no clear photo-manipulation artifacts visible, but the uniform fonts and missing required elements make the document potentially fraudulent or incomplete and its authenticity cannot be confirmed.","decision":"DENY"}
