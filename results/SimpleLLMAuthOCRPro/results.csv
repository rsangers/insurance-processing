0,1,DENY,UNCERTAIN,medical document missing,"The claimant, Thomas Becker, is requesting compensation for a non-refundable hotel booking due to a trip cancellation caused by a medical emergency involving his daughter. According to the 'Cancellation For Specific Reason' policy, 'Trip Cancellation' due to a 'Medical emergency' is a covered reason. However, the policy explicitly states that a medical emergency 'must be supported by a medical report'. The claimant has not submitted any medical documentation to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, there is a significant discrepancy between the claimant's name (Thomas Becker) and the name on the booking confirmation (naveen kumar). To proceed, the claimant must provide a medical report detailing the emergency and clarify their relationship to the booking. Due to the lack of mandatory supporting documentation and the name discrepancy, the claim cannot be approved at this time."
1,2,DENY,DENY,"medical document missing, the missed the medical appointment is not covered","The claimant is requesting reimbursement for a prepaid medical appointment that was missed due to a flight delay. The policy provided is a ""Cancellation For Specific Reason"" insurance policy. Upon review of the policy sections, the claim does not meet the criteria for coverage. The ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" section applies when a trip is cancelled for reasons like jury duty or a medical emergency, which is not the case here. The ""Personal Effects"" section is irrelevant. The ""Missed Departure or Missed Connection"" section covers missing a flight or connection, but the claimant was on his flight; it was the flight's late arrival that caused him to miss his appointment. The policy does not include a ""Travel Delay"" provision that would cover consequential losses, such as a missed prepaid event at the destination. Therefore, the claim is denied because the event (missing an appointment due to a flight delay) is not a covered reason under any section of the policy."
2,3,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant, Evelyne Kacou Meitiale, is filing for a trip cancellation reimbursement. The policy covers trip cancellations for a 'Medical emergency' provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant was scheduled to fly on August 13, 2011. The supporting document, a 'CERTIFICAT D'HOSPITALISATION' from Clinique Médicale de Bassam, confirms Ms. Kacou Meitiale was admitted to the hospital on August 13, 2011, for a serious medical emergency (biliary colic, cholelithiasis, cardiac distress) requiring hospitalization and surgery. This document serves as the required medical report. Since the medical emergency occurred on the day of travel and is properly documented, the claim falls under the covered reasons for Trip Cancellation. The claimant has also provided proof of booking. Therefore, the claim meets the policy requirements for approval."
3,4,DENY,DENY,name is redacted,"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the policy. The claimant has provided proof of booking for a flight on December 23, 2022. However, the supporting medical certificate is dated December 21, 2012, and covers an inability to work from December 20, 2012, to December 24, 2012. This document is from ten years prior to the scheduled travel and does not substantiate the claim that the policyholder was ill and unable to travel in December 2022. Due to the discrepancy in dates, the provided medical certificate is not valid for this claim. Therefore, the claim is denied for failing to provide valid supporting documentation for the covered reason."
4,5,APPROVE,DENY,NA,"The claim is denied due to invalid supporting documentation. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, but requires a valid medical report. The provided document, intended as a medical certificate, has critical discrepancies. Firstly, the name on the certificate is 'Bonfanti Obiiero', which does not match the claimant's name, 'Olivier Bayante'. Secondly, the content of the note does not confirm a medical emergency or declare the individual unfit to travel. Instead, it appears to discuss work hours ('Will have the job post at 12.30...') and mentions being attached to a 'curriculum'. As the documentation fails to substantiate a medical emergency for the claimant, the claim does not meet the policy requirements."
5,6,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,"the flight is in 2 weeks from now, it is not clear if the person will still be hospitalized or otherwise unable to fly","The claim is for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The claimant's partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz, was hospitalized on July 22, 2017, and remains hospitalized. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate from the clinic confirming the hospitalization dates and the patient's identity. This documentation satisfies the policy's requirement for a medical report to support a medical emergency claim. The incident occurred after the booking was made, and the claim was filed in a timely manner. As all conditions for a covered cancellation are met, the claim is approved."
6,7,DENY,APPROVE,the document is generally suspicious: stamp with signature seems photoshopped onto a non-printed document. the document mentions that the person was 'discharged on' but does not have the date.,"The claim is for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant has provided both. The supporting documents confirm the traveler's name (Gloria Emperatriz Mi Nano Reyna), the booking details, and a medical certificate from Clínica Sánchez Ferrer. The certificate states that the traveler was hospitalized on August 13, 2015. As the flight was scheduled for September 13, 2015, the hospitalization directly prevented the traveler from undertaking the trip. Although the discharge date is not clearly visible on the document, the document itself is dated September 15, 2015, which is after the flight's departure date, substantiating the claim that the traveler was not fit to travel. The claim meets the policy's requirements for a covered cancellation."
7,8,DENY,APPROVE,the medical document is in text form. this MUST be denied.,"The claimant, Naomi Feldman, is filing for a missed flight on December 14, 2024, due to a medical emergency. The policy explicitly covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claimant has provided a hospital admission record confirming she was admitted on December 13, 2024, for acute gastroenteritis and was not discharged until 16:35 on December 14, 2024. Her flight was scheduled for 08:20 on December 14, 2024, making it impossible for her to have boarded. The medical report also advised against travel for 48 hours. The claim is supported by the required medical documentation and proof of booking, meeting all policy conditions for approval."
8,9,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claim is for the cost of a missed flight due to a medical emergency. The policy's 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section explicitly lists 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)' as a covered reason. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate from Centro Médico Integral NOVAMEDIC, which confirms an emergency eye surgery on the day of the flight, July 29, 2023, and a prescribed rest period that made travel impossible. The claimant has also supplied proof of the flight booking and its cost (€129). As all required documentation has been provided for a covered event, the claim is valid. The requested amount of €129 is the total bill amount, which is in line with the policy's payout terms for trip cancellation."
9,10,DENY,DENY,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claim is denied for two primary reasons. Firstly, there is a significant discrepancy in the supporting documentation. The medical certificate provided is for a child named 'MONTSERRAT BECERRIL GALVÁN', whereas the claim is made for the claimant's daughter, 'LUCÍA FERNÁNDEZ'. This invalidates the medical certificate as proof for this specific claim. Secondly, even if the names matched, the policy covers cancellations or missed departures due to a 'Medical emergency'. The provided document and the claim description indicate a scheduled, non-emergency medical check-up where the child was found to be 'CLÍNICAMENTE SANA' (Clinically Healthy). A routine check-up does not qualify as a medical emergency under the terms of the policy. Therefore, the reason for missing the flight is not a covered event."
10,11,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant missed her flight on January 25, 2023, due to a severe migraine, which is considered a medical emergency. The policy explicitly covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claimant has provided a valid medical certificate dated on the day of the flight, which confirms the diagnosis ('MIGRANA SEVERA'), the time of the hospital visit (11:45 to 12:52), and the doctor's recommendation for 12 hours of rest. Given the flight's departure time of 15:10, it would have been impossible for the claimant to travel. The claimant has also provided the necessary flight booking confirmation. The provided documentation is sufficient and aligns with the policy's requirements for a covered event. No exclusions apply."
11,12,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant, Amy Ndiaye, is requesting a refund for a flight she missed on December 2, 2022. The reason provided is an emergency hospitalization on December 1, 2022. 

The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation' for a 'Medical emergency' provided it is supported by a medical report, and proof of booking is supplied.

The claimant has provided both required documents:
1. A medical certificate ('Certificat d'hospitalisation') from Dr. Ndama NIANG at Hôpital Principal de Dakar, confirming that Amy Ndiaye was hospitalized from December 1, 2022, due to abdominal trauma. This confirms a medical emergency that prevented her from traveling on December 2, 2022.
2. The internal flight data confirms the booking in her name for a flight on December 2, 2022, and shows the amount paid.

The claim meets all the criteria for a covered event under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. There are no indications of any applicable exclusions. Therefore, the claim should be approved."
12,13,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,suspicious dating on the document (17/11/2023 stamp),"The claimant missed their flight on December 16, 2023, due to a medical emergency, which is a covered reason under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The claimant has provided the required supporting documents. The hospitalization certificate from Hôpital Saint-Louis confirms the claimant was hospitalized on the same day as his scheduled flight. The internal flight data confirms the booking details and the price paid. Although the date the certificate was issued ('Fait à PARIS le 17/11/2023') precedes the hospitalization date, this is assessed as a likely clerical error, as the document's content correctly refers to the hospitalization of December 16-17, 2023 in the past tense. The claim fulfills the policy's conditions for a medical emergency."
13,14,DENY,DENY,medical document states the patient is healthy,"The claim is for the cancellation of a sports camp for the claimant's daughter, Lily Fang, due to a stated medical issue. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a valid medical report. The claimant has provided proof of booking for €450 and a medical certificate for Lily Fang dated September 5, 2018, which is before the event on September 7, 2018. However, the medical certificate explicitly states that Lily Fang 'Ne présente actuellement aucune contre-indication apparente à la pratique du sport suivant Course à Pied, y compris en compétition,' which translates to 'Currently presents no apparent contraindication to the practice of the following sport Running, including in competition.' This document certifies that the child is fit for sports, rather than being unfit to participate. The evidence provided directly contradicts the basis of the claim, which is that a medical issue prevented participation. As the required supporting documentation does not validate the reason for the claim, the claim is denied."
14,15,DENY,DENY,the name is obscured in the medical document and visible initials do not correspond,"The claimant, Roy Hoffman, is seeking a refund for a train ticket booked for June 27, 2007. The reason for the claim is an urgent pathological-anatomical examination that took place on the same day, preventing him from traveling. The policy's 'Trip Cancellation' section covers cancellations due to a 'Medical emergency' when supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided a medical report from a pathology practice dated June 27, 2007, which confirms a medical procedure was performed. This aligns with the policy's requirements for a covered reason. However, the policy contains an exclusion for 'Late reporting', which states a claim may be rejected if submitted more than 30 days after the policy expired. Assuming the policy expired on the day of the trip, June 27, 2007, the deadline for submission would have been July 27, 2007. The internal data indicates the current date is August 8, 2007, which is 42 days after the policy's expiration. As the claim was submitted outside the 30-day reporting period, it is subject to denial based on this exclusion."
15,16,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, which must be supported by a medical report. The claimant, Piccirilly Francesca, submitted a claim for a train ticket she could not use on April 14, 2017, due to an urgent hospitalization on that same day. The supporting documents confirm this. The 'Certificato di Ricovero' (hospitalization certificate) validates that she was admitted to the hospital on April 14, 2017. The 'internal train data.md' document confirms her booking for a train journey on the same date. Since a medical emergency is a covered reason and the claimant has provided both the required medical documentation and proof of booking, the claim meets the policy's criteria for approval."
16,17,DENY,DENY,"documentation states the claimant is in good condition, lacks a signature","The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
The document appears to be a blank template or digitally produced certificate rather than a completed official medical record: it lacks a date, treating physician name, signature and official stamp/seal, and contains inconsistent formatting (underlined/bold name and unusual punctuation in the ID) suggesting it was not finalized or may have been edited. There are no clear photo-manipulation artifacts visible, but the uniform fonts and missing required elements make the document potentially fraudulent or incomplete and its authenticity cannot be confirmed."
17,18,DENY,APPROVE,a picture is attached instead of the medical certificate,"The claim is for a flight cancellation due to a medical emergency, which is a specifically covered reason under the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section of the policy. The policy requires valid supporting documentation, including a medical report and proof of booking. The claimant has provided a 'hospital admission document.png', which substantiates the medical emergency, and 'internal flight data.md', which confirms the flight booking and the fact that the claimant was a no-show. The timeline of the claim is also within reasonable limits, as the flight was on December 14, 2024, and the claim is being processed on January 10, 2025, which is less than the 30-day limit for late reporting mentioned in the exclusions. As all stated requirements are met, the claim should be approved."
18,19,APPROVE,DENY,NA,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a valid medical report. The claimant, Marcos Junes, has submitted a claim for a missed train on September 20, 2013, due to a medical issue. While proof of booking is provided, the supporting medical certificate is issued to a different person, 'Horacio Humos,' not the claimant. Because the medical documentation does not pertain to the claimant, it fails to meet the policy's requirement for valid supporting documentation. Therefore, the claim is denied."
19,20,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,no signature on the medical certificate,"The claimant, Yenny Marlen Mendoza Cepeda, has filed a claim for trip cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claimant provided a 'CERTIFICACION DE HOSPITALIZACION' dated April 22, 2020, which is the same day as the scheduled flight. This document confirms her hospitalization at Hospital Universitario Barrios Unidos, serving as the required medical documentation. The claimant also provided the flight booking confirmation, satisfying the 'Proof of booking and amount paid' requirement. As the reason for cancellation is covered by the policy and is supported by valid documentation, the claim is eligible for approval."
20,21,DENY,UNCERTAIN,no supporting documentation provided,"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant, Camila Navarro Lopez, has requested a refund for a flight on February 27, 2020, stating she was unable to travel due to a serious accident on the same day. She has provided a booking confirmation for the flight in question. However, the claim is missing the required medical report to validate the medical emergency. The claimant mentions having a signed document from the attending physician but has not included it in the submitted documents. As per the policy, a claim can be rejected for 'Incomplete documentation'. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved at this time. The decision is 'UNCERTAIN' pending the submission of the required medical certificate."
21,22,DENY,DENY,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claimant, José Juan Robledo Romero, is requesting a refund for a train ticket he missed on October 19, 2015. He states that a medical check-up on the same day took longer than expected, causing him to miss his departure. The policy covers trip cancellation for specific reasons, including a 'medical emergency'. The claimant provided a medical certificate dated for the day of travel; however, this certificate explicitly states that he is in 'Prefecto estado de Salud' (Perfect state of Health) and his diagnosis is 'SANO' (HEALTHY). This indicates the visit was a routine check-up, not a medical emergency. The 'Missed Departure' section of the policy covers unforeseen incidents, using 'traffic accident en route' as an example. A planned appointment that runs late does not fit this category of unforeseen emergency and is considered a result of personal planning. Therefore, the reason for missing the train is not a covered event under the policy."
22,23,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,the document has weird dating (2016 in the bottom),"The claim is for the cancellation of a hotel stay due to a medical emergency. The policyholder, Esteban Pillasagua, was unable to check into the Hotel Monteverde Boutique on December 14, 2015, because his daughter required emergency medical attention. The provided 'Cancellation For Specific Reason' policy covers 'Trip Cancellation' for a 'Medical emergency'. The claimant has supplied the necessary supporting documents: a medical certificate from Hospital Sagrado Corazón de Jesús confirming his daughter was treated on December 14, 2015, and prescribed 24 hours of bed rest, and a document with the booking details confirming the dates and cost of the hotel. As the reason for the claim is a covered event and the required documentation has been provided, the claim is approved."
23,24,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,minor date problem - appointment is 3 days after the flight,"The claimant is requesting a refund for a train journey missed on February 2, 2017, due to a medical issue. The policy covers trip cancellation for a 'Medical emergency' when supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided both a booking confirmation and a medical certificate. The medical certificate, dated February 5, 2017, confirms a diagnosis of Sinusitis for the claimant. Although the medical consultation occurred three days after the scheduled travel date, the policy does not explicitly require the consultation to be on the exact date of travel. The documentation confirms a valid medical condition that would reasonably prevent travel. The claim includes all required documentation and falls under a covered reason. Therefore, the claim is approved."
24,25,DENY,UNCERTAIN,medical document missing,"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a stated dental emergency. According to the policy, 'Trip Cancellation' due to a 'Medical emergency' is a covered reason. The provided supporting documents confirm the booking details, including the price of €1594.44 and the check-in date of July 12, 2024. However, the policy explicitly requires that a medical emergency 'must be supported by a medical report'. While the claimant mentions an 'attached dental certificate,' this document has not been provided in the claim submission. Under the 'What Is Not Covered' section, a claim can be rejected for 'Incomplete documentation'. As the mandatory medical certificate is missing, the claim cannot be approved at this time. The decision is UNCERTAIN, pending the submission of the required proof of the medical emergency."
