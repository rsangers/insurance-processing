{"reasoning":"The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The claimant, Camila Navarro Lopez, has requested a refund for a flight on February 27, 2020, stating she was unable to travel due to a serious accident on the same day. She has provided a booking confirmation for the flight in question. However, the claim is missing the required medical report to validate the medical emergency. The claimant mentions having a signed document from the attending physician but has not included it in the submitted documents. As per the policy, a claim can be rejected for 'Incomplete documentation'. Therefore, the claim cannot be approved at this time. The decision is 'UNCERTAIN' pending the submission of the required medical certificate.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
