{"reasoning":"The claimant, Daniel Müller, cancelled his trip to Hotel Vistaluna Milano due to an unexpected dental emergency on July 12, 2024, the same day as the check-in. The policy covers \"Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)\" as a reason for trip cancellation. The claim states that the emergency appointment was necessary to treat an acute abscess, requiring immediate intervention, and mentions an attached dental certificate as confirmation. Both the booking confirmation and the details of the booking are provided. The current date is August 15, 2024, which is within 30 days of the presumed policy expiration (assuming the policy was active during the trip dates). Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim aligns with the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' clause under 'What Is Covered' due to a medical emergency, and the required documentation (medical report, proof of booking) is mentioned as being available or provided in the claim description and supporting documents.","decision":"APPROVE"}
