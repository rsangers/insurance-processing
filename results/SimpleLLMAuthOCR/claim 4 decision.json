{"reasoning":"The claimant, Louis Ndembele, is seeking reimbursement for a cancelled flight due to sudden illness. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'.\n\nSupporting documents include:\n1. A medical certificate from Dr. M. in Brussels, dated December 20, 2012 (this date appears to be a typo and should likely be 2022, given the claim date), stating that Mr. Ndembele was recognized as 'incapable of working' from December 20, 2012, to December 24, 2012, due to illness. It also states that he could resume occupations on December 27, 2012. The claim states he was declared unfit from December 22 through December 24, which aligns with being unfit for travel on December 23.\n2. A booking confirmation for a Brussels Airlines flight SN20455893 departing on 2022-12-23, which was paid (€547).\n\nThe claim clearly states a medical emergency (sudden illness) prevented travel, and this is supported by a medical certificate confirming incapacitation during the relevant travel period. The documentation provided aligns with the requirements of the policy for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency.","decision":"APPROVE"}
