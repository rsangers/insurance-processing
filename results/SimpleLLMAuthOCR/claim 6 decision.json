{"reasoning":"The claimant, Marta Rojas Valbuena, is requesting cancellation for an upcoming flight due to a medical emergency involving her partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The submitted documentation includes a certificate from Clinica Reina Sofía confirming that Jorge Luis Velosa Ruiz was admitted to the emergency room on July 22, 2017, transferred to hospitalization on July 23, 2017, and is still hospitalized as of July 27, 2017. The current date is July 27, 2017, and the flight is scheduled for August 15, 2017. This medical emergency prevents the partner from traveling and thus justifies the trip cancellation. The claim meets the criteria for a covered reason and adequate supporting documentation.","decision":"APPROVE"}
