{"reasoning":"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation due to medical emergencies if supported by a medical report. The claimant provided a medical certificate from February 5, 2017, diagnosing sinusitis (ICD-10: J66) and stating that they had a consultation on that date. The train journey was scheduled for February 2, 2017. While the medical certificate is dated after the travel date, the claim description states that the medical issue worsened the day before travel and that the claimant felt too unwell to travel on the morning of the trip. The policy does not explicitly state that the medical report must be dated on or before the travel date, only that the medical emergency must be supported by a medical report. Given that the medical certificate confirms a condition that would reasonably prevent travel and states the consultation was on Feb 5, it serves as valid supporting documentation for a medical emergency that occurred around the travel date. Therefore, the medical issue is a covered reason.","decision":"APPROVE"}
