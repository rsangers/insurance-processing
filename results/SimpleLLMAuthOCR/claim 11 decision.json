{"reasoning":"The claimant missed their domestic flight due to a severe migraine attack, which required hospitalisation and 12 hours of rest as confirmed by a medical certificate. The policy covers \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling\" due to a \"Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)\". The provided medical certificate (medical 3.webp) confirms a diagnosis of \"MIGRAÑA SEVERA\" (severe migraine) and advises 12 hours of rest, which prevented the claimant from making the flight. The flight details (supporting1.md) confirm the missed flight on the same date as the medical emergency. Therefore, the claim falls under the covered reason of a medical emergency leading to a missed flight.","decision":"APPROVE"}
