0,1,DENY,UNCERTAIN,medical document missing,"The claimant states that they were unable to check in at the hotel due to a sudden medical emergency involving their daughter, who experienced a severe allergic reaction the night before the scheduled departure. The policy covers ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"" under Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling. The claim description clearly outlines a medical emergency that led to the cancellation. However, the provided documents do not include a medical report to support the medical emergency claim, which is a required condition for coverage."
1,2,DENY,DENY,"medical document missing, the missed the medical appointment is not covered","The claimant is requesting reimbursement for a missed medical appointment due to a delayed flight. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' due to a covered reason. However, the examples provided for covered reasons under 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' are 'traffic accident en route'. A delayed flight, especially one that simply 'did not land in time', is not explicitly listed as a covered reason under this section or implicitly covered by other sections like 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' which requires a medical emergency, jury duty, or theft/criminal incident, none of which apply here. The policy also states that claims may be rejected if it is 'Not a covered reason'. Therefore, while the claimant missed an appointment due to travel, the specific cause of the delay (delayed flight impacting arrival time) is not listed as a covered reason for compensation within this policy."
2,3,APPROVE,DENY,NA,"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
The document contains multiple red flags: the stated total (491,300 FCFA) does not match the sum of the line items (which sum to ~621,300 FCFA), a patient block appears blurred/edited, and the signature/stamp areas show pixelation and misalignment consistent with digital compositing. Typography and color inconsistencies, a generic email address and low-resolution graphic elements further reduce credibility, so I consider it likely not an authentic official hospital certificate without direct verification from the clinic."
3,4,DENY,APPROVE,name is redacted,"The claimant, Louis Ndembele, is seeking reimbursement for a cancelled flight due to sudden illness. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'.

Supporting documents include:
1. A medical certificate from Dr. M. in Brussels, dated December 20, 2012 (this date appears to be a typo and should likely be 2022, given the claim date), stating that Mr. Ndembele was recognized as 'incapable of working' from December 20, 2012, to December 24, 2012, due to illness. It also states that he could resume occupations on December 27, 2012. The claim states he was declared unfit from December 22 through December 24, which aligns with being unfit for travel on December 23.
2. A booking confirmation for a Brussels Airlines flight SN20455893 departing on 2022-12-23, which was paid (€547).

The claim clearly states a medical emergency (sudden illness) prevented travel, and this is supported by a medical certificate confirming incapacitation during the relevant travel period. The documentation provided aligns with the requirements of the policy for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency."
4,5,APPROVE,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The claimant, Olivier Bayante, states that he had to cancel his flight due to feeling unwell on October 31st and was advised by an on-site doctor not to work or travel. This aligns with the 'Medical emergency' clause in the policy, which is a covered reason for trip cancellation. The policy requires a medical report for a medical emergency. The provided document 'Italian_medical_2a.jpg' is a medical certificate from 'UCINI CATINA - ADICO M GUARDA' (likely Dr. Lucini Cristina, as mentioned in the claim) dated 31.X.2011. However, the content of this document is partially illegible or doesn't clearly state that Mr. Bonfanti Obiiero (which seems to be a different name than the claimant, Olivier Bayante) was unfit to travel due to a medical condition. It seems to certify that 'Sig. Bonfanti Obiiero, Avrà il posto di lavoro alle ore 12.30 Lunedì escluso giovedì.' which translates roughly to 'Mr. Bonfanti Obiiero, Will have the workplace at 12:30 on Monday excluding Thursday.' It also mentions 'Si unisce al curriculum.' or 'It is attached to the curriculum.' This document does not clearly provide medical evidence that *Olivier Bayante* was unfit to travel. Therefore, the supporting documentation for the medical emergency is insufficient, making the decision 'UNCERTAIN'."
5,6,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,"the flight is in 2 weeks from now, it is not clear if the person will still be hospitalized or otherwise unable to fly","The claimant, Marta Rojas Valbuena, is requesting cancellation for an upcoming flight due to a medical emergency involving her partner, Jorge Velosa Ruiz. The policy covers trip cancellation for a medical emergency, provided it is supported by a medical report. The submitted documentation includes a certificate from Clinica Reina Sofía confirming that Jorge Luis Velosa Ruiz was admitted to the emergency room on July 22, 2017, transferred to hospitalization on July 23, 2017, and is still hospitalized as of July 27, 2017. The current date is July 27, 2017, and the flight is scheduled for August 15, 2017. This medical emergency prevents the partner from traveling and thus justifies the trip cancellation. The claim meets the criteria for a covered reason and adequate supporting documentation."
6,7,DENY,APPROVE,the document is generally suspicious: stamp with signature seems photoshopped onto a non-printed document. the document mentions that the person was 'discharged on' but does not have the date.,"The claim states that Gloria Mi Nano Reyna had to cancel her flight due to hospitalization. The policy covers trip cancellation due to a medical emergency, which must be supported by a medical report. The provided medical document, 'CONSTANCIA DE HOSPITALIZACIÓN', confirms that Gloria Emperatriz Mi Nano Reyna was hospitalized from August 13, 2015. Although the discharge date is not explicitly stated, the claimant mentions she was discharged after the scheduled departure date of September 13, 2015, and her condition was too fragile to travel. This falls under a covered reason (medical emergency) and is supported by a medical certificate. The booking details are also provided."
7,8,DENY,APPROVE,the medical document is in text form. this MUST be denied.,"The claimant, Naomi Feldman, states that she was unable to board her flight on December 14, 2024, due to a medical emergency. The attached hospital admission and discharge documentation, hospital admission1.md, confirms that she was admitted to Pacific Grove Medical Center on December 13, 2024, and discharged on December 14, 2024, with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis. The medical report explicitly states that travel was advised against for 48 hours. The flight details in supporting1.md show a departure date of December 14, 2024, which aligns with the time she was advised not to travel. The policy covers ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"" under Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling. All required documentation, including valid supporting documentation (medical report) and proof of booking, has been provided. Therefore, the claim falls within the covered reasons for trip cancellation/rescheduling due to a medical emergency."
8,9,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant missed the flight due to an emergency eye surgery, which is classified as a medical emergency. The policy explicitly states that medical emergencies supported by a medical report are a covered reason for Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling. The provided medical certificate confirms the surgery on the day of the flight and a subsequent rest period that rendered the claimant unfit to travel. The claim includes proof of booking and the amount paid. The condition for payout for Trip Cancellation is up to the total bill amount, which aligns with the requested compensation."
9,10,DENY,APPROVE,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claimant, Alejandra Fernández, missed her flight due to a mandatory medical check-up for her daughter. The policy covers ""Missed Departure or Missed Connection"" if due to a 'covered reason'. One of the examples of a covered reason for 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' is a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claim mentions a 'last-minute medical check-up required for my daughter' and includes a medical certificate as supporting documentation. While the medical certificate states the daughter was 'clinically healthy', the key factor is that the medical check-up was 'unforeseen scheduling and duration' and 'made it impossible for us to arrive at the airport on time'. This can be reasonably interpreted as a medical-related event that caused the missed departure. The policy does not explicitly list 'mandatory medical check-up' as a covered reason, but 'medical emergency' is a broad term that can encompass unforeseen medical appointments that prevent travel. The supporting document confirms a medical evaluation took place on the day of the flight. Therefore, the missed flight due to an unexpected mandatory medical check-up, supported by a medical certificate, falls under the spirit of a covered reason for a missed departure."
10,11,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant missed their domestic flight due to a severe migraine attack, which required hospitalisation and 12 hours of rest as confirmed by a medical certificate. The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" due to a ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"". The provided medical certificate (medical 3.webp) confirms a diagnosis of ""MIGRAÑA SEVERA"" (severe migraine) and advises 12 hours of rest, which prevented the claimant from making the flight. The flight details (supporting1.md) confirm the missed flight on the same date as the medical emergency. Therefore, the claim falls under the covered reason of a medical emergency leading to a missed flight."
11,12,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant, Amy Ndiaye, missed her flight on December 2, 2022, due to an emergency hospitalization for an abdominal trauma. The supporting medical certificate confirms her hospitalization from December 1, 2022, and describes her medical condition, which includes a 'menace d'avortement précoce post traumatique' (threat of early post-traumatic miscarriage). The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" due to a ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)."" The provided medical certificate serves as valid supporting documentation. The flight booking information confirms the claimant's details and the missed flight on the specified date. Therefore, the claim falls under the covered reasons for trip cancellation."
12,13,UNCERTAIN,DENY,suspicious dating on the document (17/11/2023 stamp),"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
The document shows multiple red flags: the issuance date (17/11/2023) is earlier than the stated hospital stay (16/12/2023–17/12/2023), the logo and header are crisp while the body text, signature block and stamp are uneven in quality and appear pasted or heavily compressed, and the signature/stamp area is illegible and pixelated. These inconsistencies in dates, image quality and the low-quality signature/stamp strongly suggest manipulation or forgery rather than a clean original hospital certificate."
13,14,DENY,DENY,medical document states the patient is healthy,"The claimant, Camille Martin, is seeking reimbursement for a sports camp her daughter, Lily Fang, could not attend due to a medical issue. The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" due to a ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"".

However, the provided medical certificate (French_medical_1.webp) from Dr. Sylvie, dated 5/9/18, states two contradictory points:
1. ""Certifie que : Mr, Mme, l'enfant FANG Lily ... Doit être dispensé d'éducation physique et sportive Pendant ______ jours, à compter du ______"" (Certifies that: Mr, Mrs, the child FANG Lily ... Must be exempted from physical education and sports For ______ days, starting from ______). This section is unchecked.
2. ""Ne présente actuellement aucune contre-indication apparente à la pratique du sport suivant Course à Pied, y compris en compétition."" (Currently presents no apparent contraindication to the practice of the following sport Running, including in competition.) This section is checked.

While the claim description mentions Dr. Sylvie issued a medical certificate indicating Lily FANG ""ne pouvait pas pratiquer d'activités physiques, y compris le canoë en compétition, pour des raisons de santé ('cause à pied')"", the actual medical certificate states the opposite for ""Course à Pied"" (Running), which was checked, and the box indicating exemption from physical activity was left unchecked.

The claim states the stage was for ""canoë-kayak"" (canoe-kayak). The medical certificate specifically notes ""Course à Pied"" (Running) and does not mention canoe-kayak or any general restriction from physical activity. In fact, it explicitly states she has no contraindications for running, even in competition.

Therefore, the medical documentation does not support the claim that Lily Fang was medically unable to participate in the canoe-kayak sports camp. The condition for a medical emergency—that it ""must be supported by a medical report""—is not met by the provided document."
14,15,DENY,APPROVE,the name is obscured in the medical document and visible initials do not correspond,"The claimant, Roy Hoffman, states that he could not take his planned train journey on June 27, 2007, due to an urgent pathological-anatomical examination in Frankfurt am Main. He has provided a medical report as proof. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' for a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The provided medical document, 'German_1.jpg', confirms that a patient, R, G (which seems to be the first initial of the claimant's first name, last name), underwent a pathological-anatomical assessment with an entry date of 27.06.2007. The medical report details a diagnosis of 'Gering differenziertes, solides und papilläres, invasives Urothelcarcinom der Harnblase', which is a serious medical condition (poorly differentiated, solid and papillary, invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder), supporting the claim of a medical emergency. The train booking information for Roy Hoffman confirms a departure from Frankfurt(Main) Hbf on 2007-06-27 at 14:50, matching the date of the medical emergency. The claim for reimbursement due to a medical emergency is supported by the medical report, fulfilling the conditions for a covered reason under the policy's 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' section."
15,16,APPROVE,APPROVE,NA,"The claimant, Piccirilly Francesca, is requesting a refund for a train ticket because she was urgently hospitalized on the day of travel. The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" due to a ""Medical emergency,"" which must be supported by a medical report. The claimant has provided a medical certificate of hospitalization from ""P.O. ""Renzetti"" which states she was admitted and discharged on April 14, 2017, the same day as the train ticket. The train ticket details also confirm the booking for April 14, 2017, from Pescara Centrale to Milano Centrale, with a price of €38.

The medical emergency is a covered reason, and valid supporting documentation (medical certificate) and proof of booking and amount paid (internal train data) have been provided. Therefore, the claim should be approved."
16,17,DENY,DENY,"documentation states the claimant is in good condition, lacks a signature","The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:
The document lacks key authentication elements — there is no date, no treating physician name, no signature or official stamp, and the bottom “Datos del Médico Tratante:” field is blank; additionally the ID formatting and selective bold/underline on the name look like basic word-processor edits rather than an issued certificate. I do not observe clear pixel-level cloning or paste artifacts, but the missing mandatory fields and formatting inconsistencies make this appear incomplete or potentially fraudulent."
17,18,DENY,APPROVE,a picture is attached instead of the medical certificate,"The claimant, Daniel Romero, states that he was unable to board his flight on December 14, 2024, due to a medical emergency. He experienced acute abdominal pain the night before the flight and was admitted to a hospital. The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" due to a ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"". Mr. Romero has provided a ""hospital admission document.png"" which serves as the medical report supporting his claim of a medical emergency. The flight details confirm a no-show for the flight on December 14, 2024. Therefore, the claim aligns with the covered reasons and documentation requirements of the policy."
18,19,APPROVE,UNCERTAIN,NA,"The claimant, Marcos Junes, was unable to board their train due to an acute medical condition (gastroenteritis) on September 20, 2013. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' due to a 'Medical emergency' and requires a medical report as supporting documentation. The claimant has provided a medical certificate from Dr. Líder Pinargote C. dated September 20, 2013, which states a presumptive diagnosis of gastroenteritis and recommends general treatment and hydration. Although the medical certificate is for ""Horacio Humos"", the claim description explicitly states ""Marcos Junes"" was diagnosed and was unable to travel as planned. This discrepancy in names creates uncertainty. According to the supporting document 'Spanish_medical_6.jpeg', the medical certificate is for ""Horacio Humos"" which contradicts the claimant's name ""Marcos Junes"" in the claim description and 'supporting1.md'. This inconsistency needs clarification to confirm that the medical emergency indeed pertained to the claimant."
19,20,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,no signature on the medical certificate,"The claimant states that they were unable to take their flight on April 22, 2020, due to a medical emergency and provides a hospitalization certificate as proof. The policy covers ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling"" for a ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"". The supporting document confirms the claimant, Yenny Marlen Mendoza Cepeda, was hospitalized on April 22, 2020, matching the flight date. This aligns with the policy's criteria for a covered reason and required documentation. The flight details also show the departure date as 2020-04-22, which is the same as the hospitalization date. The claim submission is within the general timeframe as the current date is May 10, 2020."
20,21,DENY,APPROVE,no supporting documentation provided,"The claimant states they were unable to take their flight on February 27, 2020, due to a serious accident requiring urgent medical attention. They were treated at Emiro Quintero Cañizares Hospital, sustaining multiple injuries, and have a signed medical document confirming the diagnosis and hospitalization. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' due to a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claimant has all necessary supporting documents, including the flight details and the medical emergency and is within the policy period for reporting the claim."
21,22,DENY,DENY,the medical certificate states the person is healthy,"The claim states that José missed his train because a medical evaluation took longer than expected and he had to complete certain personal legal requirements. The policy covers ""Missed Departure or Missed Connection"" if due to a covered reason. However, the examples of covered reasons for missed departure are ""traffic accident en route."" The policy also lists ""Medical emergency"" as a covered reason for ""Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling."" While José presents a medical certificate, the medical certificate states he is ""SANO"" (healthy), which rules out a medical emergency. The reason provided for missing the train, which involved a medical check-up taking longer than expected and completing legal requirements, does not fall under any of the explicitly covered reasons for missing a departure, nor does it qualify as a medical emergency. Therefore, the reason for missing the train is not covered by the policy."
22,23,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,the document has weird dating (2016 in the bottom),"The claim states that the customer was unable to use a hotel reservation due to a medical emergency involving their daughter. The provided medical certificate confirms that the daughter was diagnosed with a severe headache (ICD10: G44.X) and was prescribed 24 hours of absolute bed rest on December 14, 2015, which coincides with the check-in date of the hotel booking. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' due to a 'Medical emergency' and requires it to be supported by a medical report, which has been provided. Therefore, the reason for cancellation is covered by the policy."
23,24,UNCERTAIN,APPROVE,minor date problem - appointment is 3 days after the flight,"The claim is for a trip cancellation due to a medical emergency. The policy covers trip cancellation due to medical emergencies if supported by a medical report. The claimant provided a medical certificate from February 5, 2017, diagnosing sinusitis (ICD-10: J66) and stating that they had a consultation on that date. The train journey was scheduled for February 2, 2017. While the medical certificate is dated after the travel date, the claim description states that the medical issue worsened the day before travel and that the claimant felt too unwell to travel on the morning of the trip. The policy does not explicitly state that the medical report must be dated on or before the travel date, only that the medical emergency must be supported by a medical report. Given that the medical certificate confirms a condition that would reasonably prevent travel and states the consultation was on Feb 5, it serves as valid supporting documentation for a medical emergency that occurred around the travel date. Therefore, the medical issue is a covered reason."
24,25,DENY,APPROVE,medical document missing,"The claimant, Daniel Müller, cancelled his trip to Hotel Vistaluna Milano due to an unexpected dental emergency on July 12, 2024, the same day as the check-in. The policy covers ""Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)"" as a reason for trip cancellation. The claim states that the emergency appointment was necessary to treat an acute abscess, requiring immediate intervention, and mentions an attached dental certificate as confirmation. Both the booking confirmation and the details of the booking are provided. The current date is August 15, 2024, which is within 30 days of the presumed policy expiration (assuming the policy was active during the trip dates). Therefore, based on the information provided, the claim aligns with the 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' clause under 'What Is Covered' due to a medical emergency, and the required documentation (medical report, proof of booking) is mentioned as being available or provided in the claim description and supporting documents."
