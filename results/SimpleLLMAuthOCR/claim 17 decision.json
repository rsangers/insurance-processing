{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document lacks key authentication elements — there is no date, no treating physician name, no signature or official stamp, and the bottom “Datos del Médico Tratante:” field is blank; additionally the ID formatting and selective bold/underline on the name look like basic word-processor edits rather than an issued certificate. I do not observe clear pixel-level cloning or paste artifacts, but the missing mandatory fields and formatting inconsistencies make this appear incomplete or potentially fraudulent.","decision":"DENY"}
