{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document contains multiple red flags: the stated total (491,300 FCFA) does not match the sum of the line items (which sum to ~621,300 FCFA), a patient block appears blurred/edited, and the signature/stamp areas show pixelation and misalignment consistent with digital compositing. Typography and color inconsistencies, a generic email address and low-resolution graphic elements further reduce credibility, so I consider it likely not an authentic official hospital certificate without direct verification from the clinic.","decision":"DENY"}
