{"reasoning":"The claimant missed the flight due to an emergency eye surgery, which is classified as a medical emergency. The policy explicitly states that medical emergencies supported by a medical report are a covered reason for Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling. The provided medical certificate confirms the surgery on the day of the flight and a subsequent rest period that rendered the claimant unfit to travel. The claim includes proof of booking and the amount paid. The condition for payout for Trip Cancellation is up to the total bill amount, which aligns with the requested compensation.","decision":"APPROVE"}
