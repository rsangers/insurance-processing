{"reasoning":"The claimant, Camille Martin, is seeking reimbursement for a sports camp her daughter, Lily Fang, could not attend due to a medical issue. The policy covers \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling\" due to a \"Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)\".\n\nHowever, the provided medical certificate (French_medical_1.webp) from Dr. Sylvie, dated 5/9/18, states two contradictory points:\n1. \"Certifie que : Mr, Mme, l'enfant FANG Lily ... Doit être dispensé d'éducation physique et sportive Pendant ______ jours, à compter du ______\" (Certifies that: Mr, Mrs, the child FANG Lily ... Must be exempted from physical education and sports For ______ days, starting from ______). This section is unchecked.\n2. \"Ne présente actuellement aucune contre-indication apparente à la pratique du sport suivant Course à Pied, y compris en compétition.\" (Currently presents no apparent contraindication to the practice of the following sport Running, including in competition.) This section is checked.\n\nWhile the claim description mentions Dr. Sylvie issued a medical certificate indicating Lily FANG \"ne pouvait pas pratiquer d'activités physiques, y compris le canoë en compétition, pour des raisons de santé ('cause à pied')\", the actual medical certificate states the opposite for \"Course à Pied\" (Running), which was checked, and the box indicating exemption from physical activity was left unchecked.\n\nThe claim states the stage was for \"canoë-kayak\" (canoe-kayak). The medical certificate specifically notes \"Course à Pied\" (Running) and does not mention canoe-kayak or any general restriction from physical activity. In fact, it explicitly states she has no contraindications for running, even in competition.\n\nTherefore, the medical documentation does not support the claim that Lily Fang was medically unable to participate in the canoe-kayak sports camp. The condition for a medical emergency—that it \"must be supported by a medical report\"—is not met by the provided document.","decision":"DENY"}
