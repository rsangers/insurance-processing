{"reasoning":"The claimant, Alejandra Fernández, missed her flight due to a mandatory medical check-up for her daughter. The policy covers \"Missed Departure or Missed Connection\" if due to a 'covered reason'. One of the examples of a covered reason for 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' is a 'Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)'. The claim mentions a 'last-minute medical check-up required for my daughter' and includes a medical certificate as supporting documentation. While the medical certificate states the daughter was 'clinically healthy', the key factor is that the medical check-up was 'unforeseen scheduling and duration' and 'made it impossible for us to arrive at the airport on time'. This can be reasonably interpreted as a medical-related event that caused the missed departure. The policy does not explicitly list 'mandatory medical check-up' as a covered reason, but 'medical emergency' is a broad term that can encompass unforeseen medical appointments that prevent travel. The supporting document confirms a medical evaluation took place on the day of the flight. Therefore, the missed flight due to an unexpected mandatory medical check-up, supported by a medical certificate, falls under the spirit of a covered reason for a missed departure.","decision":"APPROVE"}
