{"reasoning":"The claim states that José missed his train because a medical evaluation took longer than expected and he had to complete certain personal legal requirements. The policy covers \"Missed Departure or Missed Connection\" if due to a covered reason. However, the examples of covered reasons for missed departure are \"traffic accident en route.\" The policy also lists \"Medical emergency\" as a covered reason for \"Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling.\" While José presents a medical certificate, the medical certificate states he is \"SANO\" (healthy), which rules out a medical emergency. The reason provided for missing the train, which involved a medical check-up taking longer than expected and completing legal requirements, does not fall under any of the explicitly covered reasons for missing a departure, nor does it qualify as a medical emergency. Therefore, the reason for missing the train is not covered by the policy.","decision":"DENY"}
