{"reasoning":"The claimant, Olivier Bayante, states that he had to cancel his flight due to feeling unwell on October 31st and was advised by an on-site doctor not to work or travel. This aligns with the 'Medical emergency' clause in the policy, which is a covered reason for trip cancellation. The policy requires a medical report for a medical emergency. The provided document 'Italian_medical_2a.jpg' is a medical certificate from 'UCINI CATINA - ADICO M GUARDA' (likely Dr. Lucini Cristina, as mentioned in the claim) dated 31.X.2011. However, the content of this document is partially illegible or doesn't clearly state that Mr. Bonfanti Obiiero (which seems to be a different name than the claimant, Olivier Bayante) was unfit to travel due to a medical condition. It seems to certify that 'Sig. Bonfanti Obiiero, Avrà il posto di lavoro alle ore 12.30 Lunedì escluso giovedì.' which translates roughly to 'Mr. Bonfanti Obiiero, Will have the workplace at 12:30 on Monday excluding Thursday.' It also mentions 'Si unisce al curriculum.' or 'It is attached to the curriculum.' This document does not clearly provide medical evidence that *Olivier Bayante* was unfit to travel. Therefore, the supporting documentation for the medical emergency is insufficient, making the decision 'UNCERTAIN'.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
