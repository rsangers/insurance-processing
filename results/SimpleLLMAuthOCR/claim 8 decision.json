{"reasoning":"The claimant, Naomi Feldman, states that she was unable to board her flight on December 14, 2024, due to a medical emergency. The attached hospital admission and discharge documentation, hospital admission1.md, confirms that she was admitted to Pacific Grove Medical Center on December 13, 2024, and discharged on December 14, 2024, with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis. The medical report explicitly states that travel was advised against for 48 hours. The flight details in supporting1.md show a departure date of December 14, 2024, which aligns with the time she was advised not to travel. The policy covers \"Medical emergency (must be supported by a medical report)\" under Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling. All required documentation, including valid supporting documentation (medical report) and proof of booking, has been provided. Therefore, the claim falls within the covered reasons for trip cancellation/rescheduling due to a medical emergency.","decision":"APPROVE"}
