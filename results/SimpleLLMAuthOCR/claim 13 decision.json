{"reasoning":"The claim was declined because supporting documents were deemed to be not authentic:\nThe document shows multiple red flags: the issuance date (17/11/2023) is earlier than the stated hospital stay (16/12/2023–17/12/2023), the logo and header are crisp while the body text, signature block and stamp are uneven in quality and appear pasted or heavily compressed, and the signature/stamp area is illegible and pixelated. These inconsistencies in dates, image quality and the low-quality signature/stamp strongly suggest manipulation or forgery rather than a clean original hospital certificate.","decision":"DENY"}
