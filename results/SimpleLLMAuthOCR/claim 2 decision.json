{"reasoning":"The claimant is requesting reimbursement for a missed medical appointment due to a delayed flight. The policy covers 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' due to a covered reason. However, the examples provided for covered reasons under 'Missed Departure or Missed Connection' are 'traffic accident en route'. A delayed flight, especially one that simply 'did not land in time', is not explicitly listed as a covered reason under this section or implicitly covered by other sections like 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' which requires a medical emergency, jury duty, or theft/criminal incident, none of which apply here. The policy also states that claims may be rejected if it is 'Not a covered reason'. Therefore, while the claimant missed an appointment due to travel, the specific cause of the delay (delayed flight impacting arrival time) is not listed as a covered reason for compensation within this policy.","decision":"DENY"}
