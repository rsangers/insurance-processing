{"reasoning":"The claimant, Marcos Junes, was unable to board their train due to an acute medical condition (gastroenteritis) on September 20, 2013. The policy covers 'Trip Cancellation or Rescheduling' due to a 'Medical emergency' and requires a medical report as supporting documentation. The claimant has provided a medical certificate from Dr. Líder Pinargote C. dated September 20, 2013, which states a presumptive diagnosis of gastroenteritis and recommends general treatment and hydration. Although the medical certificate is for \"Horacio Humos\", the claim description explicitly states \"Marcos Junes\" was diagnosed and was unable to travel as planned. This discrepancy in names creates uncertainty. According to the supporting document 'Spanish_medical_6.jpeg', the medical certificate is for \"Horacio Humos\" which contradicts the claimant's name \"Marcos Junes\" in the claim description and 'supporting1.md'. This inconsistency needs clarification to confirm that the medical emergency indeed pertained to the claimant.","decision":"UNCERTAIN"}
